The employed model finds two regimes in each of these markets. The identified regimes are further utilized in formulating the asset allocation strategies based on market synchronization and Sharpe ratio. The results suggest that BRIICKS is not a homogeneous asset class and each market should be independently evaluated in terms of its regime switching behavior, volatility persistence and level of synchronization with other emerging markets.

The study finally concludes that Russia, India and China as the best assets to invest within this emerging market basket which can be pooled with a mature market portfolio to achieve further benefits of risk diversification.},

In this chapter, we introduce a state-dependent investment strategy based on a set of indicators that we believe are useful in identifying economic and financial regimes and apply it to a universe consisting of four of the most important and liquid developed government bond markets: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. The results show that portfolios optimised across regimes have properties markedly different from those optimised using conventional asset allocation approaches. The findings may indicate that the regime-optimised allocations are exposed to an additional risk factor that, when priced, could give rise to an expected excess return over standard mean-variance portfolios.},

  abstract             = {This research studies asset allocation in the presence of regime switching in asset returns, with two underlying models, the Multivariate Regime Switching Model and the Univariate Regime Switching Model. To our knowledge this thesis is the first to construct and compare the Univariate Regime Switching Model with the Multivariate Regime Switching Model both statistically as distribution parameters estimators and with respect to their application to the asset allocation framework.

The asset allocation decision in this thesis is based on the two before mentioned Regime Switching Models and compared to the more familiar case of a non-regime switching model that relies on the mean-variance framework where asset returns are assumed to be normal. Allowing the returns distribution to follow a joint distribution of two regimes, characterized as bear and bull markets, allows us to make more realistic approximations and simulations of real financial markets, which furthermore, allows the asset allocation strategies to take into account the so called extreme events, namely the fat tails of the returns distribution.

The first part of this research is devoted to analyzing the raw data, determining regimes and estimating the parameters corresponding to those regimes which are found to be significant. The regimes identified are named bear regime, characterized with high volatility in returns and negative mean returns, and bull regime, characterized with low volatility and positive mean returns. Furthermore, as two different Regime Switching Models are constructed, a statistical comparison is carried out. The second part of the research makes use of the two different identifications of regimes in asset allocation models. The two asset allocation models are compared individually as well as with a non-switching model. All models exhibit different results for the asset allocation decision, both with respect to the length of the investment horizon and to various levels of risk aversion. Furthermore we both consider the asset allocation case of a buy-and-hold strategy as well as allowing for rebalancing of the portfolio.

Overall this research shows that using Regime Switching Models allows us to better represent the current financial markets, as we are able to go beyond the unsatisfactory assumption of the normal distribution of asset returns. This allows us to better model the turbulent financial markets by taking into consideration fat tails in returns distributions when implementing asset allocation strategies.},

  abstract     = {Regime switching models can match the tendency of financial markets to often change their behavior abruptly and the phenomenon that the new behavior of financial variables often persists for several periods after such a change. While the regimes captured by regime switching models are identified by an econometric procedure, they often correspond to different periods in regulation, policy, and other secular changes.

In empirical estimates, the regime switching means, volatilities, autocorrelations, and cross-covariances of asset returns often differ across regimes, which allow regime switching models to capture the stylized behavior of many financial series including fat tails, heteroskedasticity, skewness, and time-varying correlations. In equilibrium models, regimes in fundamental processes, like consumption or dividend growth, strongly affect the dynamic properties of equilibrium asset prices and can induce non-linear risk-return trade-offs.

Regime switches also lead to potentially large consequences for investors' optimal portfolio choice.},

Portfolio optimization is the most developed method to examine the optimal decision for asset allocation. We employ the hidden Markov model to identify regimes in varied financial markets; a regime switching model gives multiple distributions and this information can convert the static mean-variance model into an optimization problem under uncertainty, which is the case for unobservable market regimes.

We construct a stochastic program to optimize portfolios under the regime switching framework and use scenario generation to mathematically formulate the optimization problem. In addition, we build a simple example for a pension fund and examine the behavior of the optimal solution over time by using a rolling-horizon simulation. We conclude that the regime information helps portfolios avoid risk during left-tail events.},

To perform the complete analysis, we have built a historical vintage database for the euro area going back to 1970 for two monthly macroeconomic variables of major importance for short-term economic outlook, namely the industrial production index and the unemployment rate.},

The results identify different regimes with periods of high and low volatility for most HF indices. In-sample estimation results reveal a superior performance of the MS-GARCH model. The findings show that regime switching is related to structural changes in the market factor for most strategies. Out-of-sample forecasting shows that the MS-GARCH formulation provides more accurate volatility forecasts for most forecast horizons and for most HF strategies. Inclusion of MS dynamics in the GARCH specification highly improves the volatility forecasts for those strategies that are particularly sensitive to general macroeconomic conditions, such as Distressed Restructuring and Merger Arbitrage.},

In the High-Variance Regime, only value stocks deliver a good performance, whereas in the Low-Variance Regime, the market portfolio and momentum stocks promise high returns.

Regime-switching induces investors to change their portfolio style over time depending on the investment horizon, the risk aversion, and the prevailing regime. Value investing seems to be a rational strategy in the High-Variance Regime, momentum investing in the Low-Variance Regime. An empirical out-of-sample backtest indicates that this switching strategy can be profitable, but the overall forecasting ability for the regime-switching model seems to be weak compared to the iid model.},

Nevertheless, for all-equity portfolios, a regime-switching strategy dominates static strategies out-of-sample.

During the period 1970-2010, the US market was driven by four regimes, namely, normal , crisis , recovery and low-volatility regimes.

In both crisis and low-volatility regimes, low (high) quality, high (low) liquidity-beta and illiquid (liquid) stocks exhibit an increase (a decrease) in their market betas. These findings are consistent with flight-to-quality (flight-to-liquidity) episodes during crisis periods and with flight-to-low-quality (flight-to-illiquidity) explanation during low volatility times.

Finally, our results reveal that liquidity-level is more important than liquidity-beta in predicting market-beta during crisis periods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the dependence structure of the asset classes stocks, government bonds, and corporate bonds in different market environments and its implications on asset management are investigated for the US, European, and Asian market. Asset returns are modelled by a Markov-switching model which allows for two market regimes with completely different risk-return structures. Using major stock indices from all three regions, calm and turbulent market periods are identified for the time period between 1987 and 2009 and the correlation structures in the respective periods are compared.

It turns out that the correlations between as well as within the asset classes under investigation are far from being stable and vary significantly between calm and turbulent market periods as well as in time. It also turns out that the US and European markets are much more integrated than the Asian and US/European ones. Moreover, the Asian market features more and longer turbulence phases. Finally, the impact of these findings is examined in a portfolio optimization context. To accomplish this, a case study using the mean-variance and the mean-conditional-value-at-risk framework as well as two levels of risk aversion is conducted.

The results show that an explicit consideration of different market conditions in the modelling framework yields better portfolio performance as well as lower portfolio risk compared to standard approaches. These findings hold true for all investigated optimization frameworks and risk-aversion levels.},

The risky asset is in the form of a stock generated using regime-switching parameters with a Markov chain explaining the state of the economy. The optimization of the portfolio is carried out under certain assumptions and reasonable constraints on risk, transaction costs and amount traded. The constraint on nancial risk is implemented through the recognized mean-variance criterion, balancing the expected value of the portfolio against the variance of the portfolio after every time period. The algorithm is implemented using quadratic programming techniques in Matlab. By varying parameters of the model a sensitivity analysis is performed. Simulated scenarios and the behaviour of the algorithm is presented in graphs. The algorithm is found to be rational and outperforms a static portfolio in every scenario.},

The state space of the Markovian regime-switching process is assumed to be a countably infinite set. To characterize the value function of the risk sensitive stochastic control problem, we investigate the corresponding recursive infinite-dimensional nonlinear dynamical programming equations (DPEs) based on default states. We propose to work in the following procedure: Applying the theory of the monotone dynamical system, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to the recursive DPEs by a truncation argument in the finite state space. Moreover, the associated optimal feedback strategy is characterized by developing a rigorous verification theorem. Building upon results in the first stage, we construct a sequence of approximating risk sensitive control problems with finite state space and prove that the resulting smooth value functions will converge to the classical solution of the original system of DPEs. The construction and approximation of the optimal feedback strategy for the original problem are thoroughly discussed. Some numerical results are also presented to illustrate our analytical conclusions.},

Take the conditional value-at-risk measure as an example, we demonstrate the resulting multi-stage portfolio selection problem can be transformed into a second-order cone programming problem. Finally, we carry out a series of empirical tests to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed random framework and the corresponding multi-stage portfolio selection model.},

The optimal policy is to trade partially towards an aim portfolio with a given trading speed. In a given state, the aim portfolio is a weighted average of mean-variance portfolios in every state, where the weight is a function of the probability of transitioning to that state, and the state's persistence, risk and trading costs. The trading speed is higher in states that are more persistent, where return volatility is higher and trading costs are lower. It can be optimal to deviate substantially from the mean-variance efficient portfolio (or from the risk-parity allocation) and to underweight high Sharpe ratio (high volatility) assets, as well as to trade more aggressively the less liquid assets in anticipation of an increase in their volatility and trading costs. We illustrate our approach in an empirical exercise in which we exploit time-variation in the expected return, volatility, and cost of trading of the value-weighted market portfolio of US common stocks. We estimate a regime switching model applied to a dataset of institutional trades, and find that realized trading costs are significantly higher when market volatility is high. The optimal dynamic strategy significantly outperforms a myopic trading strategy in an out-of-sample experiment. The highest gains arise from timing the changes in volatility and trading costs rather than expected returns.},

However, in academia and practice financial markets are often modeled as time consistent, resulting in static investment strategies that are assumed to be ecient. This has great implications on investors' allocation decisions and in valuation of risks and performances. In this thesis we consider different risk factors and their behaviour over time. By using a hidden market model, which allow the risk factors to jump between 2 different regimes, we are able to identify distinctly different behaviour for all the risk factors in the different regimes. We are then able to design different investment strategies and use an online implementation of the model that field significant better returns than equivalent static investment strategies. Our results give further proof of the benefits of using regime based models when working with portfolio decisions. We also suggest a shrinkage approach to the covariance matrix estimations that gives increased stability to the model and makes it highly applicable in practice.},

We find that well over half of the SandP 500 index by market capitalization and seven of its ten sector component indices exhibited at least some bubble-like behavior over our sample period. Thus the speculative bubble that grew in the 1990s and subsequently collapsed was surprisingly pervasive in the US equity market and it affected numerous sectors including financials and general industrials, rather than being confined to information technology, telecommunications and the media. In addition, we develop a joint model for cross-sectional contagion of bubbles across the sectors and we examine whether there is evidence for bubble spillovers.},

Taking this into account, we propose a simple statistical model to identify speculative bubbles in financial markets. Through the estimates of the time varying parameters, including transition probabilities, we can identify when and how newly born bubbles grow and burst over time. The model can be estimated by recursive computations, which require a huge storage capacity for standard computers. For this reason, we introduce an approximation in the computation, maintaining the recursive nature of our estimation technique. We then apply this model to the stock markets of the United States, Japan, and China, estimate its parameters and the probabilities of a bubble crash, and obtain several interesting results: the time series data of the stock price bubble show an inherently non-stationary development and the probability of a bubble crash indeed increases as the stock price becomes too high or too low. We build a simple statistical model to identify speculative bubbles in financial markets. Our model fits the real data very well without requiring a large sample in contrast with existing models in this literature. We propose a condense method for Baysian computation while maintaining the recursive nature of our estimation. Our empirical results show that there have been bubbles in the stock markets of United States, Japan and China.},

Cryptocurrencies trade at prices which is mainly driven by investor sentiment, becoming a potential source of financial bubbles and instabilities.

In this work, we draw upon the close relationship between statistics, physics and mathematical finance to apply quantitative models to the study of Bitcoin and Ether, two of the most famous cryptocurrencies. Our bubble detection methodology combines the Log Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, originally created by Johansen, Ledoit and Sornette (JLS), and the statistical model developed by Phillips, Shi, and Yu (PSY). In particular, we employ three different versions of LPPL model, i.e. Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Generalised Least Squares (GLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and two PSY statistical tests (BSADF and BSADF*).

We find that, during the sample period 1st December 2016 - 13th December 2017, Bitcoin shows strong bubble signals, starting in May-September 2017 and reaching a critical time in mid December 2017. Ether, instead, presents bubble signals in mid-June 2017, corresponding to the crash actually observed on 12th June, while a second weaker signal is found by JLS-GLS only around 12th January 2018, anticipating the large crash observed in the same days.

These findings are consistent with the large crash (-30\%) observed in the cryptocurrency markets between 17th and 22nd December 2017. Further study on other cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), an innovative structure for raising funds to support new ideas and ventures, is in progress.},

Further, it is claimed that the underlying model is based on influence percolation and a martingale condition. This paper examines these claims and their validity for capturing large price falls in the Hang Seng stock market index over the period 1970 to 2008. The fitted LPPLs have parameter values within the ranges specified post hoc by Johansen and Sornette (2001) for only seven of these 11 crashes. Interestingly, the LPPL fit could have predicted the substantial fall in the Hang Seng index during the recent global downturn. Overall, the mechanism posited as underlying the LPPL model does not do so, and the data used to support the fit of the LPPL model to bubbles does so only partially.},

Previous research into the model has primarily focused on equity markets where different market dynamics may prevail.

This study is the first to apply the model to a broad range of currencies and examine its predictive performance. Such a bubble alarm would be valued by many market participants, from central banks monitoring their domestic currency to asset managers managing their forex exposures. The model is calibrated on a range of developed market currencies, both on cross rates and exchange rate indices. The performance of bubble alarms suggests the model has predictive ability for both indices and cross rates, with greater predictive power for the latter.

A Lattice Alarm is introduced which aggregates market information from multiple cross rates. The performance of this alarm would suggest that monitoring a currency for bubbles exclusively through an exchange rate index may be suboptimal. We also examine macroeconomic factors which may affect economic agents' willingness and ability to herd and crowd into a bubble.

We find little evidence that funding availability contributes to bubble activity. However, we find that bubble activity is greater during times when the returns earned from currency risk factor portfolios are depressed. This supports the argument that herding behaviour is greater when economic agents face unattractive return alternatives. Furthermore, results suggest that currency bubbles may directly affect the returns of these investment strategies, specifically in the case of carry trade.},

  abstract             = {Change points are abrupt variations in time series data. Such abrupt changes may represent transitions that occur between states. Detection of change points is useful in modelling and prediction of time series and is found in application areas such as medical condition monitoring, climate change detection, speech and image analysis, and human activity analysis. This survey article enumerates, categorizes, and compares many of the methods that have been proposed to detect change points in time series. The methods examined include both supervised and unsupervised algorithms that have been introduced and evaluated. We introduce several criteria to compare the algorithms. Finally, we present some grand challenges for the community to consider.},

First we discuss the implications of structural breaks in financial time series for statistical inference purposes. In the second section we discuss the relevant asymptotic results and issues involved in general classifications of change-point tests in financial time series such historical versus sequential tests, parametric versus nonparametric tests and single versus multiple break tests. The third section reviews a number of structural change tests by focusing on certain characteristics or moments of financial time series such as structural break tests in the financial asset returns and volatility, long memory, tails and distribution.

In addition, we review changepoint tests for the codependence between financial asset returns processes in the context of multivariate volatility models, copulae and last but not least asset pricing. In concluding we provide some areas of future research in the subject.},

We operate under the most flexible definition of piecewise stationarity, and estimate the number and locations of change-points consistently as well as identifying whether they originate in the common or idiosyncratic components. Through the use of wavelets, we transform the problem of change-point detection in the second-order structure of a high-dimensional time series, into the (relatively easier) problem of change-point detection in the means of high-dimensional panel data. Our methodology circumvents the difficult issue of the accurate estimation of the true number of factors by adopting a screening procedure. In extensive simulation studies, we show that factor analysis prior to change-point detection improves the detectability of change-points, and identify and describe an interesting 'spillover' effect in which substantial breaks in the idiosyncratic components get, naturally enough, identified as change-points in the common components, which prompts us to regard the corresponding change-points as also acting as a form of 'factors'. We introduce a simple graphical tool for visualising the piecewise stationary evolution of the factor structure over time. Our methodology is implemented in the R package factorcpt, available from CRAN.},

We investigate the difficulty of change point detection near the boundaries of the time series in correlation networks and study the power of our method and competing methods through simulation.

We assess the accuracy of the models using several measures of unbiasedness and predictive accuracy, and using Diebold and Mariano's approach to test whether differences in expected losses from all possible pairs of forecast models are statistically significant. We fail to find evidence that complex statistical models are uniformly more accurate than a naive constant expected return model for factor-mimicking portfolio (excess) returns. However, we show that it is possible to build simple portfolio strategies that profit from the higher out-of-sample predictive accuracy of forecasting models with Markov switching in conditional mean coefficients. These results appear to be independent of the forecasting horizon and robust to changes in the loss function that captures the investors' objectives.},

The efficiency of the proposed change-point test is studied, which is reflected on the rate at which the cross-sectional size of a change is permitted to converge to zero while it is still detectable. Also, the consistency of the proposed change-point detection procedure based on the binary segmentation algorithm, is established in terms of both the total number and locations (in time) of the estimated change-points. Motivated by the representation properties of the Generalised Dynamic Factor Model, we propose a bootstrap procedure for test criterion selection, which accounts for both cross-sectional and within-series correlations in high-dimensional data. The empirical performance of the double CUSUM statistics, equipped with the proposed bootstrap scheme, is investigated in a comparative simulation study with the state-of-the-art. As an application, we analyse the log returns of SandP 100 component stock prices over a period of one year.},

We develop consistent estimators for the parameters and the dynamic realization of the state vector governing the option price dynamics. The estimators converge stably to a mixed-Gaussian law and we develop feasible estimators for the limiting variance. We also provide semiparametric tests for the option price dynamics based on the distance between the spot volatility extracted from the options and one constructed nonparametrically from high-frequency data on the underlying asset. Furthermore, we develop new tests for the day-by-day model fit over specific regions of the volatility surface and for the stability of the risk-neutral dynamics over time. A comprehensive Monte Carlo study indicates that the inference procedures work well in empirically realistic settings. In an empirical application to S\&P 500 index options, guided by the new diagnostic tests, we extend existing asset pricing models by allowing for a flexible dynamic relation between volatility and priced jump tail risk. Importantly, we document that the priced jump tail risk typically responds in a more pronounced and persistent manner than volatility to large negative market shocks.},

This paper provides evidence for the state-dependent tradeoff between risk and return. The hypothesis of countercyclical risk premium behavior is confirmed.

This paper empirically investigates the time series behavior of stock returns and volatility and the relationship between return premium and stock market risk by utilizing a TSV-GARCH(p,q)-Risk-Mean model. The empirical findings of this paper provide evidence for the distinct driving forces in mean and volatility and the state-dependent tradeoff between risk and return. The empirical results demonstrate that the stock market displays four types of dynamic processes (high-return low-volatility state, low-return low-volatility state, high-return high-volatility state, and low-return high-volatility state) and that the structural change process of stock market returns is greatly at odds with that of stock market volatility.

The TSV-GARCH(1,1)-Risk-Mean model provides better in-sample fit compared to the conventional GARCH(p,q) and regime-switching GARCH(p,q) models. Moreover, the relationship between excess returns and risk is positive, and the intensity of this positive relationship during periods of bear market is significantly higher than that during periods of bull market, which provides supporting evidence for the countercyclical risk premiums hypothesis in which the magnitude of compensation for enduring risk is weaker during periods of favorable financial conditions than during periods of adverse conditions.},

Our study is based on a random matrix approach recently introduced to model the non-stationarity of correlations by an ensemble of random matrices. This approach reduces the complexity of the correlated market to a single parameter which characterizes the fluctuations of the correlations and can be determined directly from the empirical return distributions.

This parameter provides an insight into the stability of the correlation structure of each market state as well as into the correlation structure dynamics in the whole observation period. The analysis reveals an intriguing relationship between average correlation and correlation fluctuations. The strongest fluctuations occur during periods of high average correlation which is the case particularly in times of crisis.},

Based on this research, we used growth and inflation expectations data to create a model that could offer insight into the probability of certain macroeconomic regimes. Changes in these expectations pointed to macroeconomic regimes in which assets have distinct performance characteristics. These regimes have varying lengths and occur at varying frequencies.

Our model seeks to provide a roadmap to the probabilities of future regimes based on the evolution of our factors, and we explore structuring portfolios to take advantage of probable transitions among them.

In a volatile macroeconomic environment marked by countercyclical supply shocks, cash, inflation-linked bonds and precious metals play an essential role, while in a more stable environment ( Great Moderation ) with procyclical demand shocks, cash and nominal bonds play the most significant role, followed by precious metals, real estate and equities.

The use of alternative risk and return measures also mitigates the issue that asset returns are not often normally distributed or serially correlated.

In this research, we consider whether regimes can add value to the asset allocation process. Four methods for regime identification - economic cycle variables, fundamental valuation metrics, technical market indicators and statistical regime-switching models - are discussed and tested on two asset universes - long-only South African equity factor returns and representative balanced portfolio asset class returns. We find several promising regime indicators and use these to create two regime-based tactical allocation frameworks. Out-of-sample testing on both the equity factor and balanced asset class data shows very promising results, with both regime-based tactical strategies outperforming their respective static benchmarks on an absolute return and risk-adjusted return basis.},

The problem is solved by introducing a functional operator. We use the dynamic programming approach which is a often used method in operational researcher. We consider the optimal asset allocation problem in a continuous-time regime-switching market. The problem is to maximize the expected utility of the terminal wealth of a portfolio that contains an option, an underlying stock and a risk-free bond. The difficulty that arises in our setting is finding a way to represent the return of the option by the returns of the stock and the risk-free bond in an incomplete regime-switching market. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a functional operator to generate a sequence of value functions, and then show that the optimal value function is the limit of this sequence. The explicit form of each function in the sequence can be obtained by solving an auxiliary portfolio optimization problem in a single-regime market. And then the original optimal value function can be approximated by taking the limit. Additionally, we can also show that the optimal value function is a solution to a dynamic programming equation, which leads to the explicit forms for the optimal value function and the optimal portfolio process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, as long as the current state of the Markov chain is given, it is still optimal for an investor in a multiple-regime market to simply allocate his/her wealth in the same way as in a single-regime market.},

Once the accuracy of our test methodology has been assessed through Monte Carlo experiments, our empirical results point out that between two and five regimes are required to capture the features of each asset's distribution.

Moreover, we show that only a part of the underlying number of regimes is explained by the distributional characteristics of the returns such as kurtosis. A thorough out-of-sample analysis provides additional evidence that there are more than just bulls and bears in financial markets. Finally, we highlight that taking into account the real number of regimes allows both improved portfolio returns and density forecasts.},

  abstract       = {We develop a dynamic model of information and asset prices in which investor information choices influence the level of available public and private information about fundamentals. We study two types of feedback. In the first, as more investors become informed, more information about fundamentals becomes available. As a consequence, two regimes emerge, one with higher prices and lower volatility, and one with lower prices and higher volatility. Information dynamics move the market between regimes, creating large market drops and rallies, with no change in fundamentals, but large changes in discount rates reflecting changes in information asymmetry between informed and uninformed investors. In the second type of feedback we study, an increase in the number of informed investors leads to greater public information through leakage or disclosures; this mechanism has a stabilizing effect. When calibrated to market data, the positive feedback model suggests a role for information dynamics in financial crises; the negative feedback model helps explain empirical findings in the literature on the market reaction to the loss of analyst coverage.},

This paper extends the stochastic dominance rules for normal mixture distributions derived by Levy and Kaplanski (2015). First, the portfolios under consideration are allowed to follow different regime-switching processes. Second, the results are extended from second- to fourth-order stochastic dominance, which is known to be closely related to kurtosis aversion in financial markets and allows to compare mixture distributions with the same overall variance. In particular, when a risk-free asset is available, checking for fourth-order stochastic dominance turns out to amount to a comparison of the regime-specific and overall Sharpe ratios of the portfolios under consideration.},

Overall, the model works well in detecting multiple bubbles in the SandP 500 between January 1888 and May 2010.

  abstract     = {Recent periods of market turbulence and stress have created considerable interest in credible alternatives to traditional asset allocation methodologies. It would be preferred if portfolios can be decomposed into components that can be directly connected to independent risks and individually rewarded by the market for their level of risk. This can be achieved through factor-based investing, which relies on the observation that most return and risk characteristics for all asset classes can be well explained by particular building blocks, or factors.

We describe main features of factors, factor investing and factor models, with emphasis placed on practical topics such as selection of significant factors associated to specific asset classes, differentiating between factors, anomalies or stylized facts, and preference for composite portfolios based on combining factors. We have also analyzed implementation details and the factor risk parity strategy.

Then we consider improvements to factor-based investing through regime switching and sensitivity analysis. We present theoretical and practical frameworks for Markov switching models and for sensitivity analysis, and rely on representative examples to illustrate the benefits of efficiently incorporating regimes and sensitivity analysis into portfolio management.

The final section describes features of good testing procedures for portfolio behavior and performance, in contrasts with possible testing pitfalls.},

We believe that the issue raised by financial bubbles can contribute to discussions on the risk-on/risk-off theory as identified by the various regime switches.

In addition to a signal indicating the presence of bubbles, we need a second signal to help us determine the theoretical date that the bubble will burst in order to determine the optimal exit time.

Our approach is built on a combination of two quantitative models: a bubble detection model and a Markov regime-switching model. These signals offer two benefits: generating absolute performance and limiting extreme risk (the tail-risk hedging strategy).

Although we only illustrate the results with the SandP 500, the approach should be generalised to all asset classes.},

Our empirical evidence confirms that the dependence structure between high-risk and low-risk stocks in the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets is not static but switches between regimes over the course of the sample horizon considered in this paper. More importantly, as a result of such regime-switching characteristics of their dependence structure, our analysis of the out-of-sample asset allocation performance indicates that employing the procedure proposed in this paper to identify regime changes and decide when to adjust portfolio weights allows investors with the Constant Relative Risk Aversion utility to achieve both higher realized returns and higher certainty equivalent rate of returns than does the use of strategies based on static models.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, no one has yet considered a global setup including both, equity and implied volatility indices of various continents, and allowing for a changing dependence structure. We aim to close this gap by applying Markov-switching R-vine models to investigate the existence of different, global dependence regimes. In particular, we identify times of normal and abnormal states within a data set consisting of North-American, European and Asian indices. Our results confirm the existence of joint points in time at which global regime switching takes place.},

A theoretical cause of the confusion between those processes is proposed with simulation evidence. Adopting the ideas of existing studies, an MRS-LMGARCH framework is further developed to control for this cause. Our Monte Carlo studies show that this model can effectively distinguish between the pure LMGARCH and pure MRS-GARCH processes. Finally, empirical studies of NASDAQ and SandP 500 index returns are conducted to demonstrate that our MRS-LMGARCH model can provide potentially more reliable estimates of the long-memory parameter, identify the volatility states and outperform both the LMGARCH and MRS-GARCH models.},

In a first step, a Markov-switching model with two regimes (a calm market and a turbulent market) is developed. Based on the time series of the monthly returns of the SandP 500 price index, the corresponding filtered probabilities are successively estimated. In a second step, the turbulent phase of the model is further specified to distinguish between bullish and bearish trends.

For comparison only, a Markov-switching model with three states (a calm market, a turbulent bullish market, and a turbulent bearish market) is examined as well. In a third step, logistic regression models are employed to forecast the filtered probabilities provided by the Markov-switching models. A major advantage of the presented modeling framework is the timely identification of the factors driving the different phases of the capital market. In a fourth step, the early warning system is applied to an asset management case study.

The results show that explicit consideration of the models' signals yields better portfolio performance and lower portfolio risk compared to standard buy-and-hold and constant proportion portfolio insurance strategies.},

Specifically, we study spontaneously emerging local order in crease networks of crumpled thin sheets, a paradigmatic example of spatial complexity, and show that machine learning techniques can be effective even in a data-limited regime. This is achieved by augmenting the scarce experimental dataset with inexhaustible amounts of simulated data of flat-folded sheets, which are simple to simulate. This significantly improves the predictive power in a test problem of pattern completion and demonstrates the usefulness of machine learning in bench-top experiments where data is good but scarce.},

  abstract             = {In this paper we build a simple ALM model where future scenarios are generated assuming a Markov regime switching framework. Using the Shiller database of monthly equity returns and interest rate data since 1870, two regimes are revealed by the data that clearly correspond to a normal regime where returns behave like expected from economic theory, and a high volatility regime we may also refer to as a crisis regime . Given the evidence of the non-stationarity of economic variables, we investigate the added value of reducing risk in the portfolio when the model indicates a high probability of a regime shift. The persistence of each of the regimes is high. This framework gives, each month and for each scenario, the probability of being in one of the two regimes, and hence the multivariate distribution of the simulated variables that pertains to the relevant regime. These variables are (1) equity returns, (2) long term (10-year) interest rates, (3) realized inflation, and (4) short term (6-month) interest rates. We then investigate a number of relevant statistics of the terminal wealth achieved after a 20-year period for two typical portfolios: a long-only portfolio well-diversified over stocks and bonds where the relevant metric is the portfolio's value (for instance, an endowment fund), and a pension fund's coverage ratio where the fund's liabilities are valued by a market interest rate curve. We show that both types of investors greatly benefit from adjusting their exposure to equities and interest rates conditionally on the expected risk regime. Finally, we show the consequence when both the endowment fund manager and the pension fund board members optimize their own reward/risk ratio from their job. We argue that in such a case they seek to minimize the probability of large losses (either in absolute terms or relative to the pension fund's liabilities), while maximizing the minimum level of wealth (or coverage ratio for the pension fund) achieved with a given (say 95 confidence level. We quantify the added value of the risk-regime depending allocations for such managers.},

The market parameters exhibit "regime-switching" in the sense of being adapted to the joint filtration of the Brownian motion in the asset price models and a given finite-state Markov chain which models ? regimes ? of the market. The goal is to minimize a general quadratic loss function of the wealth at close of trade subject to the constraint that the vector of dollar amounts in each stock remains within a given closed convex set. We apply a conjugate duality approach, the essence of which is to establish existence of a solution to an associated dual problem and then use optimality relations to construct an optimal portfolio in terms of this solution. The optimality relations are also used to compute explicit optimal portfolios for various convex cone constraints when the market parameters are adapted specifically to the Markov chain.},

Equity returns exhibit higher volatilities and correlations, and lower expected returns, in bear markets compared to bull markets. However, static mean-variance analysis fails to capture this salient feature of equity returns.

Using a regime switching model across both regions and sectors, the regime-dependent asset allocation substantially outperforms the static mean-variance allocation. This outperformance is robust to various asset allocation constraints. In addition, optimal allocation across sectors provide greater benefits compared to international diversification, which is characterized by higher returns, lower risks, lower correlations with the world market and a higher Sharpe ratio.},

Specifically, we extend the existing risk budgeting approach of Richard and Roncalli (2015) to allow for changing market regimes, factor dependence and nonlinear and asymmetric market structure. We show that the existing framework can be readily extended to include a factor-dependent return process using standard models available in the literature. Structural changes in market conditions are then incorporated into the framework through the use of a regime-switching turbulence index and the nonlinear and asymmetric market dependence structure is accounted for by using quantile factor models. Most importantly, this extended framework is only comprised of a series of linear models, and is thus simple to understand and implement. We consider two applications of the extended framework, namely scenario analysis and parameter uncertainty analysis, through means of a simple empirical case study. Finally, we introduce the concept of Risk Maps, which provide managers with a graphical approach for estimating and evaluating risk optimality in a multi-objective and multi-scenario setting.},

  abstract       = {Energy markets are strategic to governments and economic development. Several commodities compete as substitutable energy sources and energy diversifiers. Such competition reduces the energy vulnerability of countries as well as portfolios' risk exposure. Vulnerability results mainly from price trends and fluctuations, following supply and demand shocks. Such energy price uncertainty attracts many market participants in the energy commodity markets. First, energy producers and consumers hedge adverse price changes with energy derivatives. Second, financial market participants use commodities and commodity derivatives to diversify their conventional portfolios. For that reason, we consider the joint dependence between the United States (U.S.) natural gas, crude oil and stock markets. We use Gatfaoui's (2015) time varying multivariate copula analysis and related variance regimes. Such approach handles structural changes in asset prices. In this light, we draw implications for portfolio optimization, when investors diversify their stock portfolios with natural gas and crude oil assets. We minimize the portfolio's variance, semi-variance and tail risk, in the presence and the absence of constraints on the portfolio's expected return and/or U.S. stock investment. The return constraint reduces the performance of the optimal portfolio. Moreover, the regime-specific portfolio optimization helps implement an enhanced active management strategy over the whole sample period. Under a return constraint, the semi-variance optimal portfolio offers the best risk-return tradeoff, whereas the tail-risk optimal portfolio offers the best tradeoff in the absence of a return constraint.},

In particular, the paper shows both theoretically and through an application to international equity portfolio diversification that substantial differences exist between bull and bear regime-specific frontiers, both in statistical and in economic terms. Using Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) investable indices for five countries/macro-regions, it is possible to characterize the mean-variance frontiers and optimal portfolio strategies in bull periods, in bear periods, and in periods where high uncertainty exists on the nature of the current regime.

Optimal asset allocations vary considerably across these states and change over time as investors revise their estimates of the state probabilities. In the crash state, buy-and-hold investors allocate more of their portfolio to stocks the longer their investment horizon, while the optimal allocation to stocks declines as a function of the investment horizon in bull markets.

The joint effects of learning about state probabilities and predictability of asset returns from the dividend yield give rise to a non-monotonic relationship between the investment horizon and the demand for stocks.

This paper studies three major indexes and utilizes the Iterated Cumulative Sums of Squares (ICSS) algorithm to capture time periods of sudden changes in volatility. The findings suggest that persistence of shocks to volatility is not as high as generally perceived. Volatility persistence declines significantly when regime shifts are combined with a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model.

The authors find a disconnect between the statistical perspective, whereby the ratios yield a modest forecasting power, and a portfolio approach, by which a moderate predictability is often sufficient to yield significant portfolio outperformance, especially before transaction costs and when regimes are taken into account. However, also when regimes are considered, predictability gives high payoffs only to long horizon, highly risk-averse investors.

But most professional databases do not retain time series for companies that drop from the database and do not necessarily track changes in the benchmarks over time. Consequently, standard tests of portfolio performance suffer from look-ahead benchmark bias, meaning that a given strategy is naively backtested against the assets constituting the benchmark of reference at the end of the testing period (i.e., now), rather than at the beginning of the period. In this article, the authors report that look-ahead benchmark bias can be surprisingly large in portfolios of common stocks-up to 8 percent per annum when the SandP 500 Index is the benchmark. Using CRSP data for the running top 500 U.S. capitalizations over the period 1927-2006, the authors demonstrate that look-ahead benchmark bias can account for a gross overestimation in performance metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio, as well as an underestimation of risk measured, for example, by peak-to-valley drawdowns. A general methodology to test investment strategy properties is advanced by the authors in the context of several random strategies having similar investment constraints.},

First, we present a new model for obtaining the probability of equity crises within one year in advance, and we test it. Second and separately, various markets already in crises appear quantitatively related to a theory of nonlinear diffusion called the Reggeon Field Theory calculated years ago. Details are in a longer companion paper i.

The time dynamics of the origins of crises are commonly pictured by bubbles growing and collapsing. Our dynamic model, the "CEEC (Critical Exponent Earthquake Crisis) Model", has these features , and can provide early warning equity crisis signals to help prevent losses. The CEEC Model uses concepts of "critical exponents"from physics plus a qualitative analogy from earthquakes to describe the build-up of bubbles (increase of "frictional stress") with subsequent crises from bubble collapses ( "earthquakes") . The only inputs to the CEEC model for an equity index are equity index returns.

Tests comparing the CEEC model to data yield encouraging results, much better than chance. Here are results from running the model as the user would have run it in the past:

In 69 percent of the tests for which the model indicated a crisis in the short term (within one year), a crisis was in fact observed within one year.

31 percent of actual crises were missed by the model within one year before the crisis.

We give a summary of the CEEC model in this short paper. A longer companion paper describing full details of the model will appear.

We also analyze various markets already in crisis (equity, FX, commodities, rates, bonds). We find behavior numerically consistent with a theoretical result with no free parameters for the general theory of nonlinear diffusion in physics, generalizing standard Brownian motion, the Reggeon Field Theory RFT. An anomalous RFT critical exponent translated into finance language is around 0.3, and this number qualitatively describes the average behavior of markets in crisis.

This 0.3 RFT anomalous variance exponent is perhaps the first number calculated in advance since the Gaussian Brownian diffusion variance exponent (1.0) used in standard finance, without numerically fitting anything.},

To do so, this work is divided in two distinct segments. Firstly, using data from firms from 17 different countries across Europe ranging from the beginning of 2003 until the end of 2016, a cross - sectional regression analysis was performed to measure how different firm-related variables can affect stock price crash risk on an individual firm level. Secondly, building up on these findings and previous studies, we appl ied a simple but useful framework for investors to adapt their stock portfolios to such extreme events. Using a set of previously studied stock price crash predicto rs, we were able to collect a set of highly statistically significant variables that were then used to group companies into two distinct portfolios, one with "low-crash" likelihood and the other with "high-crash" likelihood. Even though we were able to ach ieve higher risk- adjusted returns with this simple strategy (Sharpe Ratio of 0.5804 on the low- crash risk portfolio against 0.4986 on the same measure for the high- crash risk portfolio), its essence differs greatly from Ak et al., (2016) work mainly because of two reasons: the way we access stock price crash likelihood and our set of "crash-flags". Besides offering a new contribute to the scarce empirical literature regarding this topic on European markets and extending Ak et al., (2016) study by using one more crash assessing measure and different stock price predictors, this work also attempts to fill an important gap between academic literature an d practical guidance on how to adapt investors' stock port folios to stock price crashes},

We then show that measures of short selling activity have robust predictive power over negative bubbles across both short and long time horizons, in line with the previous studies suggesting that short sellers have predictive ability over stock price crash risks. Market liquidity, on the other hand, is found to have robust predictive power over both the negative and positive bubbles, while its predictive power is largely limited to short horizons. Short selling and liquidity are thus identified as two important factors contributing to the LPPLS-based bubble indicators. The evidence overall points to the predictability of stock market bubbles using market-based proxies of trading activity and can be used as a guideline to model and monitor the occurrence of bubble conditions in financial markets.},

We propose an indirect quantitative test of this hypothesis and confront it with the alternative according to which bubbles persist due to the difficulty of agreeing on the end of bubbles. We present systematic tests of the precision and reliability with which the beginning t1 and end tc of a bubble can be determined.For this, we use a specific bubble model, the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) model, which represents a bubble as a transient noisy super-exponential price trajectory decorated by accelerated volatility oscillations. Generalising the estimation procedure to endogenise the beginning of the fitting time interval, we quantify the uncertainty on the calibrated t1 and tc (as well as the other model parameters) via the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, which characterise the shape of the calibration cost function in the different directions in parameter space, on many synthetic data and four historical bubble cases. We find overwhelming evidence that the beginning of bubbles is much better constrained that their end. Our results are robust over all four empirical bubbles and many synthetic tests, as well as when changing the time of analysis (the present ) during the development of the bubbles. As a bonus, we find that the two structural parameters of the LPPLS model, the exponent m controlling the super-exponential growth of price and the angular log-periodic frequency omega describing the log-periodic acceleration of volatility, are very rigid according the Hessian matrix analysis, which supports the LPPLS model as a reasonable candidate for describing the generating process of prices during bubbles.},

We apply the general approach to the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model of financial bubbles. This model is particularly relevant because one of its parameters, the critical time tc signalling the burst of the bubble, is arguably the target of choice for dynamical risk management. However, previous calibrations of the LPPLS model have shown that the estimation of tc is in general quite unstable. Here, we provide a rigorous likelihood inference approach to determine tc, which takes into account the impact of the other nonlinear (so-called nuisance ) parameters for the correct adjustment of the uncertainty on tc. This provides a rigorous interval estimation for the critical time, rather than a point estimation in previous approaches. As a bonus, the interval estimations can also be obtained for the nuisance parameters (m,w, damping), which can be used to improve filtering of the calibration results. We show that the use of the modified profile likelihood method dramatically reduces the number of local extrema by constructing much simpler smoother log-likelihood landscapes. The remaining distinct solutions can be interpreted as genuine scenarios that unfold as the time of the analysis flows, which can be compared directly via their likelihood ratio. Finally, we develop a multi-scale profile likelihood analysis to visualize the structure of the financial data at different scales (typically from 100 to 750 days). We test the methodology successfully on synthetic price time series and on three well-known historical financial bubbles.},

The power of the method is illustrated on the Chinese bubble of 2008. We present a simple transformation of the formulation of the log-periodic power law formula of the Johansen Ledoit Sornette (JLS) model of financial bubbles that reduces it to a function of only three nonlinear parameters. The transformation significantly decreases the complexity of the fitting procedure and improves its stability tremendously because the modified cost function is now characterized by good smooth properties with in general a single minimum in the case where the model is appropriate to the empirical data. We complement the approach with an additional subordination procedure that slaves two of the nonlinear parameters to the most crucial nonlinear parameter, the critical time tctc, defined in the JLS model as the end of the bubble and the most probable time for a crash to occur. This further decreases the complexity of the search and provides an intuitive representation of the results of the calibration. With our proposed methodology, metaheuristic searches are not longer necessary and one can resort solely to rigorous controlled local search algorithms, leading to a dramatic increase in efficiency. Empirical tests on the Shanghai Composite index (SSE) from January 2007 to March 2008 illustrate our findings.},

The drawdowns (resp. drawups) generalize the notion of runs of negative (resp. positive) returns so as to capture the risks to which investors are arguably the most concerned with. Similarly to the distribution of returns, we find that the distributions of drawdowns and -drawups exhibit power law tails, albeit with exponents significantly larger than those for the return distributions. This paradoxical result can be attributed to (i) the existence of significant transient dependence between returns and (ii) the presence of large outliers (Dragon-Kings) characterizing the extreme tail of the drawdown/drawup distributions deviating from the power law. The study of the tail dependence between the sizes, speeds and durations of drawdown/drawup indicates a clear relationship between size and speed but none between size and duration. This implies that the most extreme drawdown/drawup tend to occur fast and are dominated by a few very large returns. We discuss both the endogenous and exogenous origins of these extreme events.},

An exponentially growing spread between asset prices and the economy is therefore an indicator of the probability that a bubble is in the making. However, as the authors point out, this indicator alone is not sufficient as anomalous price growth can be generated by different macroeconomic scenarios. The authors discuss different macroscenarios that can lead to bubbles and the related indicators.},

The dynamics of prices thus markedly deviate from randomness in certain pockets of predictability that can be associated with bubble market regimes.

The second regime reflects the bubble period with explosive behavior. Stochastic switches between two regimes and non-constant probabilities of exit from the bubble regime are both allowed. A Bayesian learning approach is employed to jointly estimate the latent states and the model parameters in real time. An important feature of our Bayesian method is that we are able to deal with parameter uncertainty and at the same time, to learn about the states and the parameters sequentially, allowing for real time model analysis. This feature is particularly useful for market surveillance. Analysis using simulated data reveals that our method has good power properties for detecting bubbles. Empirical analysis using price-dividend ratios of SandP500 highlights the advantages of our method.},

We introduce a robust automatic peak detection method that classifies price time series into periods of uninterrupted market growth (drawups) and regimes of uninterrupted market decrease (drawdowns). In combination with the Lagrange Regularisation Method for detecting the beginning of a new market regime, we identify 3 major peaks and 10 additional smaller peaks, that have punctuated the dynamics of Bitcoin price during the analyzed time period. We explain this classification of long and short bubbles by a number of quantitative metrics and graphs to understand the main socio-economic drivers behind the ascent of Bitcoin over this period. Then, a detailed analysis of the growing risks associated with the three long bubbles using the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model is based on the LPPLS Confidence Indicators, defined as the fraction of qualified fits of the LPPLS model over multiple time windows. Furthermore, for various fictitious present analysis times t2, positioned in advance to bubble crashes, we employ a clustering method to group LPPLS fits over different time scales and the predicted critical times tc (the most probable time for the start of the crash ending the bubble). Each cluster is argued to provide a plausible scenario for the subsequent Bitcoin price evolution. We present these predictions for the three long bubbles and the four short bubbles that our time scale of analysis was able to resolve. Overall, our predictive scheme provides useful information to warn of an imminent crash risk.},

Our methodology is based on topological data analysis (TDA). We use persistence homology to detect and quantify topological patterns that appear in multidimensional time series. Using a sliding window, we extract time-dependent point cloud data sets, to which we associate a topological space. We detect transient loops that appear in this space, and we measure their persistence. This is encoded in real-valued functions referred to as a 'persistence landscapes'. We quantify the temporal changes in persistence landscapes via their Lp-norms. We test this procedure on multidimensional time series generated by various non-linear and non-equilibrium models. We find that, in the vicinity of financial meltdowns, the Lp-norms exhibit strong growth prior to the primary peak, which ascends during a crash. Remarkably, the average spectral density at low frequencies of the time series of Lp-norms of the persistence landscapes demonstrates a strong rising trend for 250 trading days prior to either dotcom crash on 03/10/2000, or to the Lehman bankruptcy on 09/15/2008. Our study suggests that TDA provides a new type of econometric analysis, which goes beyond the standard statistical measures. The method can be used to detect early warning signals of imminent market crashes. We believe that this approach can be used beyond the analysis of financial time series presented here.},

Monte Carlo simulations show excellent finite sample performance. An empirical application involving Nasdaq stock prices is discussed. Recent research has proposed using recursive right-tailed unit root tests to date the start and end of asset price bubbles. In this paper an alternative approach is proposed that utilises model-based minimum sum of squared residuals estimators combined with Bayesian Information Criterion model selection. Conditional on the presence of a bubble, the dating procedures suggested are shown to offer consistent estimation of the start and end dates of a fixed magnitude bubble, and can also be used to distinguish between different types of bubble process, i.e. a bubble that does or does not end in collapse, or a bubble that is ongoing at the end of the sample. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed dating approach out-performs the recursive unit root test methods for dating periods of explosive autoregressive behaviour in finite samples, particularly in terms of accurate identification of a bubble's end point. An empirical application involving Nasdaq stock prices is discussed.},

We then derive a general method to incorporate these selected factors in addition to the log-periodic power law signature of herding and compare the prediction accuracy of the critical time between the original and the new JLS models (termed the JLS-factor model) by applying these two models to fit two well-known Chinese stock indices in three bubble periods. The results show that the JLS-factor model with Chinese characteristics successfully depicts the evolutions of bubbles and "antibubbles" and constructs efficient end-of-bubble signals for all bubbles in Chinese stock markets. In addition, the results of standard statistical tests demonstrate the excellent explanatory power of these additive factors and confirm that the new JLS model provides useful improvements over the standard JLS model.},

The theoretical basis for investigating non-linear behavior in stock returns can be based on the interaction between noise traders and arbitrageurs or behavioral finance theories of non-linear risk aversion. As heterogeneity in investors' beliefs gives reason to suspect a smooth transition between extremes, rather than abrupt, a smooth transition regression model is estimated. Our findings support differences in non-linearity of stock returns in Japan and the US that might be linked to different shareownership of the Japanese stock market compared to the US. In addition, differences in the legal system might have some influence over our findings as well. The US results also suggest greater heterogeneity in the relationship between stock returns and macro variables in the US data relative to the Japanese data. The reasons behind the differences in our results, both between countries and between regimes are probably due to the different economic conditions faced by Japan and the US over our sample, to the possible existence of bubbles in the data and to investor behavior consistent with 'behavioral finance' theories of investor behaviour.},

In this paper, first we propose a method for the optimal determination of the state space of the Index process which is based on a change-point approach for Markov chains. Furthermore we provide an explicit formula for the probability distribution function of the first change of state of the index process.

They show that KCA presents several advantages over such popular noise-reduction methods as fast Fourier transform (FFT) or locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS). First, KCA provides band estimates in addition to point estimates. Second, KCA further decomposes the signal in terms of three hidden components, which can be intuitively associated with position, velocity, and acceleration. Third, KCA is more robust in forecasting applications. Fourth, KCA is a forward-looking, state-space approach, resilient to structural changes. The authors believe that this type of decomposition is particularly useful in the analysis of trend following, momentum, and mean reversion in financial prices. An instrument exhibits financial inertia when its price acceleration is not significantly greater than zero for long periods of time. This empirical analysis of 19 of the most liquid futures worldwide confirms the presence of strong inertia across all asset classes. The authors also argue that KCA can be useful to market makers, liquidity providers, and faders for the calculation of their trading ranges.},

The paper takes a different perspective and investigates the null hypotheses of no relevant changes, i.e. math formula, where | | is an appropriate norm. This formulation of the testing problem is motivated by the fact that in many applications a modification of the statistical analysis might not be necessary, if the difference between the parameters before and after the change point is small. A general approach to problems of this type is developed which is based on the cumulative sum principle. For the asymptotic analysis weak convergence of the sequential empirical process must be established under the alternative of non-stationarity, and it is shown that the resulting test statistic is asymptotically normally distributed. The results can also be used to establish similarity of the parameters, i.e. math formula, at a controlled type 1 error and to estimate the magnitude math formula of the change with a corresponding confidence interval. Several applications of the methodology are given including tests for relevant changes in the mean, variance, parameter in a linear regression model and distribution function among others. The finite sample properties of the new tests are investigated by means of a simulation study and illustrated by analysing a data example from portfolio management.},

Moreover, specific statistical methods allow for the prediction of rare events, even outside the range of previous observations.

All allow for adjustment of additional covariates not subjected to thresholding. We demonstrate the consistency of the estimating procedures and the type 1 error rates of the testing procedures by Monte Carlo studies, and illustrate their practical uses using an example from the study of immune response biomarkers in the context of Mother-To-Child-Transmission of HIV-1 viruses. CONCLUSION: chngpt makes several unique contributions to the software for threshold regression models and will make these models more accessible to practitioners interested in modeling threshold effects.},

The advantage of this framework is that it can dynamically detect whether a given regression coefficient is constant or time-varying during distinct time periods. We moreover compare the performance of this model with a wide range of nested alternative time-varying and constant parameter VAR models. Our results indicate that the threshold TVP-VAR outperforms its competitors in terms of point and density forecasts. A portfolio allocation exercise confirms the superiority of our proposed framework. In addition, a copula-based analysis also indicates that it pays off to adopt a multivariate modeling framework, especially during periods of stress, like the recent financial crisis.},

Our results suggest that there is no momentum in sector ETFs, and that momentum does not depend on market states in the recent decade.

Our findings have important theoretical as well as practical implications. In terms of theoretical implications, models attempting to explain momentum now have a higher hurdle to meet in that these models need to explain why momentum does not seem to exist in the recent decade. In terms of practical implications, our findings suggest that in capital budgeting, portfolio evaluation, investment and risk analysis decisions, caution should be exercised in using the models that take into account momentum effects.},

The assets of the portfolio are modeled through a hidden Markov model (HMM) in discrete time, where drift and volatility are allowed to switch between different states. We consider different parametrizations of the involved asset covariances namely state-wise uncorrelated assets, which are though linked through the common Markov chain, assets correlated in a state-independent way, and assets where the correlation varies from state to state. As a control model, we also consider a model without regime switches. We utilize a filter-based EM-algorithm to obtain optimal parameter estimates within this multivariate HMM and develop parameter estimators in all three HMM settings. We discuss the impact of these different models on the performance of several portfolio strategies. Our findings show that for simulated returns our strategies often outperform naive investment strategies, like the equal weights strategy. Information criteria can be used to detect the best model for estimation as well as for portfolio optimization. A second study using real data confirms these findings.},

Including a memory effect eliminates the empirical shortcoming of discrete state models, namely that they produce a standard and an extreme state in stock returns. So far, this has prevented the regimes from being used as a valuable conditioning variable. Based on a discrete state indicator variable, is presented evidence of considerable performance improvement relative to the static model due to optimal shifting between aggressive and well diversified portfolio structures.},

A simple specification is a three component scale mixture, where the states correspond to high, intermediate and low volatility phases of the market. Tests for the number of states in hidden Markov models are proposed and used to assess whether in view of recent financial turbulences, three volatility states are still sufficient. The tests extend tests for independent finite mixtures by using a quasi-likelihood which neglects the dependence structure of the regime. The main theoretical insight is the surprising fact that the asymptotic distribution of the proposed tests for HMMs is the same as for independent mixtures with corresponding weights. As application the number of volatility states for logarithmic returns of the SandP 500 index in two HMMs is determined, one with state-dependent normal distributions and switching mean and scale, and the other with state-dependent skew-normal distributions with switching scale and structural mean and skewness parameters. It turns out that in both models, four states are indeed required, and a maximum-a-posteriori analysis shows that the highest volatility state mainly corresponds to the recent financial crisis.},

Employing the mean-variance rule in portfolio selection without taking into account that the distribution is mixed normal leads to a loss of 2 3 percent per year. Standard mean-variance analysis is based on the assumption of normal return distributions. However, a growing body of literature suggests that the market oscillates between two different regimes one with low volatility and the other with high volatility. In such a case, even if the return distributions are normal in both regimes, the overall distribution is not it is a mixture of normals. Mean-variance analysis is inappropriate in this framework, and one must either assume a specific utility function or, alternatively, employ the more general and distribution-free Second degree Stochastic Dominance (SSD) criterion. This paper develops the SSD rule for the case of mixed normals: the SSDMN rule. This rule is a generalization the mean-variance rule. The cost of ignoring regimes and assuming normality when the distributions are actually mixed normal can be quite substantial it is typically equivalent to an annual rate of return of 2 3 percent.},

  abstract    = {Regime shifts present a big challenge to traditional strategic asset allocation, demanding a more adaptive approach. In the presence of time-varying investment opportunities, portfolio weights should be adjusted as new information arrives.

Regime-switching models can match the tendency of financial markets to change their behavior abruptly and the phenomenon that the new behavior often persists for several periods after a change. They are well suited to capture the stylized behavior of many financial series including skewness, leptokurtosis, volatility persistence, and time-varying correlations.

This thesis builds on this empirical evidence to develop a quantitative framework for regime-based asset allocation. It investigates whether regime-based investing can effectively respond to changes in financial regimes at the portfolio level in an effort to provide better long-term results when compared to more static approaches. The thesis extends previous work by considering both discrete-time and continuous-time models, models with different numbers of states, different univariate and multivariate state-dependent distributions, and different sojourn time distributions.

Out-of-sample success depends on developing a way to model the non-linear and non-stationary behavior of asset returns. Dynamic asset allocation strategies are shown to add value over strategies based on rebalancing to static weights with rebalancing in itself adding value compared to buy-and-hold strategies in an asset universe consisting of a global stock index, a global government bond index, and a commodity index.

The tested strategies based on an adaptively estimated two-state Gaussian hidden Markov model outperform a rebalancing strategy out of sample after accounting for transaction costs, assuming no knowledge of future returns, and with a realistic delay between the identification of a regime change and the portfolio adjustment.},

The predominant approach in previous studies has been to specify in advance a static decision rule for changing the allocation based on the state of financial markets or the economy. In this article, model predictive control (MPC) is used to dynamically optimize a portfolio based on forecasts of the mean and variance of financial returns from a hidden Markov model with time-varying parameters. There are computational advantages to using MPC when estimates of future returns are updated every time a new observation becomes available, since the optimal control actions are reconsidered anyway. MPC outperforms a static decision rule for changing the allocation and realizes both a higher return and a significantly lower risk than a buy-and-hold investment in various major stock market indices. This is after accounting for transaction costs, with a one-day delay in the implementation of allocation changes, and with zero-interest cash as the only alternative to the stock indices. Imposing a trading penalty that reduces the number of trades is found to increase the robustness of the approach.},

The potential benefit from taking large positions in a few assets at a time comes at the cost of reduced diversification. The authors analyze this trade-off in a multi-asset universe with great potential for static diversification. The regime-based approach is centered around a regime-switching model with time-varying parameters that can match financial markets' behavior and a new, more intuitive way of inferring the hidden market regimes. The empirical results show that regime-based asset allocation is profitable, even when compared to a diversified benchmark portfolio. The results are robust because they are based on available market data with no assumptions about forecasting skills.},

  abstract             = {Introduces a Logistic Smooth Transition pass-through regression to study ERPT dynamics. ERPT depends on the past behavior of local currency and inflation with threshold effects. Import prices respond differently to a 1 percent depreciation over ERPT regimes. ERPT has episodes of low (incomplete) and high (complete) pass-through in the data. This paper investigates departures from linearity in the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to import prices of six major economies by using a logistic smooth transition pass-through (LSTP) regression. The analysis of LSTP regressions provides the following new insights into the dynamic features of ERPT: (i) There is strong evidence for the presence of smooth transition type threshold effects in the ERPT. The identified threshold dynamics reveals the existence of two extreme regimes, one with - low- and another with - high- pass-through. (ii) Both the short-run and the long-run pass-through estimates exhibit variation across these extreme regimes and in the long-run, pass-through tends to be complete in the - high- pass-through regime and low, but, incomplete in the - low- pass-through regime. (iii) Import price elasticities are asymmetric, as such, the same 1 percent depreciation of the currency is not associated with the same degree of ERPT across regimes. (iv) Temporal behavior of ERPT for a given country is generally similar across local currency appreciation and inflation rate-driven episodes. On the other hand, there is considerable variation across countries in the speed of the transitions and the estimated thresholds under each transition variable. These findings may explain why the linear ERPT literature might have obtained mixed results on the degree of ERPT across countries and sample periods used.},

We focus on time varying multifractality in time series and introduce a multifractal regime detecting method (MRDM) adopting a nonparametric statistical test for multifractality based on generalized Hurst exponent (GHE). MRDM is a practical method to discriminate multifractal regimes in a time series of any length using a moving time window approach with the adjustable time window size and the moving interval. MRDM is applied to simulations consisting of both multifractal and monofractal regimes, and the results confirm its validity. Using MRDM, we identify multifractal regimes in the time series of Korea composite stock price index (KOSPI) from 1990 through 2012 and observe the distinct stylized facts of the KOSPI return values in multifractal regimes such as the heavy tail distribution, high kurtosis, and the long memory in volatility. Surrogate tests based on improved amplitude adjusted Fourier transformation (IAAFT) algorithm, normal distribution, and generalized student t distribution are performed for the validation of MDRM, and the probable causes of multifractality in the KOSPI series are discussed.},

However the time-varying transition probabilities for illiquidity spiral and loss spiral have changed significantly during the period under analysis and the explanatory variables are very informative in dating the evolution of the state of the illiquidity spiral and loss spiral over a period of 27 years starting with 1983. Hence TVTP model is preferred over the CTP model in identifying the illiquidity spiral and loss spiral regime switching. In particular, the probability of remaining in the high illiquidity spiral and high loss spiral regimes increases with a decrease in SandP 500 return.},

In particular, we show that the conventional Gibbs sampling is enough in generating the regime indicator variable as well as the continuous latent variable conditional on all the parameters of the model and data. For an application to business cycle modeling of postwar US real GDP, a modified version of Hamilton (1989) Markovian switching model is slightly preferred to a non-Markovian switching model by the Bayesian model selection criterion. For an application to volatility modeling of the weekly stock return, a non-Markovian switching model with endogenous switching or the leverage effect is strongly preferred to Markovian switching models.},

In a mean variance framework with factor models under regime switches, we derive a semi-analytic solution for the optimal portfolio with transaction costs. Due to the existence of transaction costs, the optimal portfolio is characterized as a linear combination of current and target portfolios, the latter of which maximizes the value function in the current regime. For some special cases of interest, we also derive simplified analytical solutions.

To see the effect of regime switches, the proposed model is applied to US equity market in which small minus big and high minus low are employed as factors. Investment strategy based on our model demonstrates empirically that the regime switching models exhibit superior performance over the single regime model for such performance measures as realized utility and Sharpe ratio which are of particular interest in practice.

Taking a close look at the time series of portfolio returns, the result shows the usefulness of the regime switching model as investors flexibly optimize asset allocations depending on the state of the market.},

The implicit assumption of a target-date fund is that exposure to loss from risky assets increases as time decreases; hence the shift to safer assets as the investment horizon shrinks. However, another implicit assumption of target-date funds is that the standard deviation of assets is relatively stationary. The typical approach for determining the glide path assumes implicitly that the asset's annualized standard deviation will not change much during any subperiod within the longer horizon. This second assumption is contrary to experience. Subperiod volatility is highly nonstationary, although it is not entirely unpredictable.

Mean-variance analysis is inappropriate in this framework, and one must either assume a specific utility function or, alternatively, employ the more general and distribution-free Second degree Stochastic Dominance (SSD) criterion. This paper develops the SSD rule for the case of Mixed Normals: the SSDMN rule. This rule is a generalization the mean-variance rule.

Design/methodology/approach - A Markov switching model is first developed to characterize real estate security markets' risk-return in two regimes. The mean-variance portfolio construction methodology is then deployed in the presence of the two regimes. Finally, the out-of-sample analyzes are conducted to examine whether the regime switching allocation outperforms the conventional allocation strategy.

Findings - Strong evidence of regimes in the six real estate security markets in detected. The correlations between the various real estate security markets' returns are higher in the bear market regime than in the bull market regime. Consequently the optimal real estate portfolio in the bear market regime is very different from that in the bull market regime. The out-of-sample tests reveal that the regime-switching model outperforms the non-regime dependent model, the world real estate portfolio and equally-weighted portfolio from risk-adjusted performance perspective.

Originality/value - The application of the Markov switching technique to real estate markets is relatively new and has great significance for international real estate diversification. With increased significance of international securitized property as a real estate investment vehicle for institutional investors to gain worldwide real estate exposure, this study provides significant insights into the investment behavior and optimal asset allocation implications of the listed real estate when returns follow a regime switching process.},

The optimal consumption and portfolio policies are explicitly characterized in terms of the Malliavin derivatives and stochastic integrals.

When the model is calibrated to U.S. stock market data, I find that continuous Bayesian revisions under incomplete information generate ambiguity-driven hedging demands that mitigate intertemporal hedging demands. In addition, ambiguity aversion magnifies the importance of hedging demands in the optimal portfolio policies.

To show the generality of the dynamic uncertainty sets under the regime switching framework, we further consider multi-period robust risk measures under time-varying uncertainty sets with moments uncertainty and discuss the tractability of the corresponding multi-period robust portfolio selection problems. A series of empirical results demonstrate that the robust portfolio selection models with regime switching can flexibly help the investor make superior and robust investment strategies according to the switching of the market environment.},

There are modifications to the standard geometric Brownian motion model which accomodate heavy tails, most notably (1) adding point processes to the Brownian motion or (2) classifying time into regimes. With regimes the prices follow Brownian motion dynamics within regime, but the parameters vary by regime. The unconditional distribution of returns is a mixture of normals, with the mixing coefficients being Markov transition probabilities. The contrasting approaches have a common link-risk factors. In the case of the point processes, the intensity of "shocks" depends on a set of factors, eg. bond-stock yield differential, credit spread, implied volatility, exchange rates. The factors drive shocks, which are a component of the returns. With regimes, the economic state is hidden (latent) and is determined by the period by period observations on factors. The characterization of regimes follows from description in terms of the set of risk factors. In this paper the link between the shocks and regimes is explored. The shocks times defined by risk factors are an alternative method of determining regimes and the classifications by shocks and by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm are examined. The connections factors -> regimes -> shocks further justifies a classification of financial markets into homogeneous epochs. The regime structure leads to improved estimates for distribution parameters. The methods are applied to the prediction of returns on Sector Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).The allocation of investment capital to funds based on predicted returns generates favorable wealth accumulation over a planning horizon.},

Based on the analysis presented here, we believe that regimebased asset allocation has the potential to deliver significant benefits when compared to traditional investment policies, which are most commonly static and benchmark based. Contingent on good economic foresight, implementation of a regime-based approach can potentially add to cumulative performance over time, translating to an improved distribution of overall portfolio returns.},

In order to compare observed and predicted policy behavior, the chapter estimates Actual and Perceived regime switching Taylor Rules for the ECB. The former is based on the refi rate set by the Governing Council while the latter relies on the professional point forecasts of the refi rate performed by a large investment bank before the upcoming policy rate decision. The empirical evidence shows that the Central Bank's main policy rate has switched between two regimes: in the first one the Taylor Principle is satisfied and the ECB stabilizes the economic outlook, while in the second regime the Central Bank cuts rates more aggressively and puts a higher emphasis on stabilizing real output growth expectations. Second, the results point out that the professional forecasters have broadly well predicted the actual policy regimes. The estimation results are also robust to using consensus forecasts of inflation and real output growth. The empirical evidence from the augmented Taylor Rules shows that the Central Bank has most likely not responded to the growth rates of M3 and the nominal effective exchange rate and the estimated regimes are robust to including these additional variables in the regressions. Finally, after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers the policy rate has switched to a crisis regime as the ECB has focused on preventing a further decline in economic activity and on securing the stability of the financial system.},

It is well-known that existence of mean break and long memory in time series can be easily confused with each other in most cases. Thus, we aim at observing the deviation and interaction of mean and d estimates for different cases. A Monte Carlo experiment reveals that the finite sample performance of the proposed algorithm for a simple mixture model of Markov-switching mean and d changes with respect to the fractional integrating parameters and the mean values for the two regimes.},

The LPPL model considers the faster-than-exponential (power law with finite-time singularity) increase in asset prices decorated by accelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles. It embodies a positive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative feedback spirals of crash expectations. We use the LPPL model in one of its incarnations to analyze two bubbles and subsequent market crashes in two important indexes in the Chinese stock markets between May 2005 and July 2009. Both the Shanghai stock exchange composite index (US ticker symbol SSEC) and Shenzhen stock exchange component index (SZSC) exhibited such behavior in two distinct time periods: (1) from mid-2005, bursting in October 2007 and (2) from November 2008, bursting in the beginning of August 2009. We successfully predicted time windows for both crashes in advance (Sornette, 2007; Bastiaensen et al., 2009) with the same methods used to successfully predict the peak in mid-2006 of the US housing bubble (Zhou and Sornette, 2006b) and the peak in July 2008 of the global oil bubble (Sornette et al., 2009). The more recent bubble in the Chinese indexes was detected and its end or change of regime was predicted independently by two groups with similar results, showing that the model has been well-documented and can be replicated by industrial practitioners. Here we present a more detailed analysis of the individual Chinese index predictions and of the methods used to make and test them. We complement the detection of log-periodic behavior with Lomb spectral analysis of detrended residuals and (H,q)(H,q)-derivative of logarithmic indexes for both bubbles. We perform unit-root tests on the residuals from the log-periodic power law model to confirm the Ornstein Uhlenbeck property of bounded residuals, in agreement with the consistent model of 'explosive' financial bubbles (Lin et al., 2009).},

Multifractal analysis provides powerful tools to understand the complex nonlinear nature of time series in diverse fields. Inspired by its striking analogy with hydrodynamic turbulence, from which the idea of multifractality originated, multifractal analysis of financial markets has bloomed, forming one of the main directions of econophysics. We review the multifractal analysis methods and multifractal models adopted in or invented for financial time series and their subtle properties, which are applicable to time series in other disciplines. We survey the cumulating evidence for the presence of multifractality in financial time series in different markets and at different time periods and discuss the sources of multifractality. The usefulness of multifractal analysis in quantifying market inefficiency, in supporting risk management and in developing other applications is presented. We finally discuss open problems and further directions of multifractal analysis.},

Return predictability is found to be driven by changing market conditions, consistent with the implication of the adaptive markets hypothesis. During market crashes, no statistically significant return predictability is observed, but return predictability is associated with a high degree of uncertainty. In times of economic or political crises, stock returns have been highly predictable with a moderate degree of uncertainty in predictability. We find that return predictability has been smaller during economic bubbles than in normal times. We also find evidence that return predictability is associated with stock market volatility and economic fundamentals.},

  abstract             = {We propose a dynamic Rational Expectations (RE) bubble model of prices with the intention to exploit it for and evaluate it on optimal investment strategies. Our bubble model is defined as a geometric Brownian motion combined with separate crash (and rally) discrete jump distributions associated with positive (and negative) bubbles. We assume that crashes tend to efficiently bring back excess bubble prices close to a "normal" or fundamental value ("efficient crashes"). Then, the RE condition implies that the excess risk premium of the risky asset exposed to crashes is an increasing function of the amplitude of the expected crash, which itself grows with the bubble mispricing: hence, the larger the bubble price, the larger its subsequent growth rate. This positive feedback of price on return is the archetype of super-exponential price dynamics, which has been previously proposed as a general definition of bubbles. Our bubble model also allows for a sequence of small jumps or long-term corrections. We use the RE condition to estimate the realtime crash probability dynamically through an accelerating probability function depending on the increasing expected return. After showing how to estimate the model parameters, we examine the optimal investment problem in the context of the bubble model by obtaining an analytic expression for maximizing the expected log of wealth (Kelly criterion) for the risky asset and a risk-free asset. We also obtain a closed-form approximation for the optimal investment. We demonstrate, on seven historical crashes, the promising outperformance of the method compared to a 60/40 portfolio, the classic Kelly allocation, and the risky asset, and how it mitigates jumps, both positive and negative.},

The beta dispersion can be interpreted as risk measure for the likelihood of market crashes and therefore function as a predictor of following market downturns. Based on the beta dispersion and the highest betas on a market, indicators are developed to predict the subsequent market return. These indicators have substantial predictive power for future market movements, even out-of-sample and if additionally controlled for other well-known predictors of the market return. Moreover, the informational content of the beta dispersion can be successfully exploited by market-timing strategies. An innovative idea of designing market-timing strategies based on timing indicators is introduced. This new approach invests in the market portfolio with a weighted position conditioning on the currently observed indicator. The market-timing strategies are able to considerably enhance the risk-return characteristics compared to a buy-and-hold investment in the market, especially by reducing the return volatility about one third.},

Granger tests detect causality running from option-implied returns to Treasury Bill yields in the pre-crisis regime with a lag of a few days, and the other way round during the post-crisis regime with much longer lags (50 200 days). This suggests a transition from an abnormal regime preceding the crisis to a new normal post-crisis.

Within the general framework built on geometric Brownian motions and based on the analogy between Brownian motion in finance and physics, the first-order effect of such a steric constraint would enter a priori in the form of a repulsive entropic force associated with the paths crossing the barrier that are forbidden. Nonparametric empirical estimates of drift and volatility show that the predicted first-order analogy between economics and physics is incorrect. The clue is to realize that the random-walk nature of financial prices results from the continuous anticipation of traders about future opportunities, whose aggregate actions translate into an approximate efficient market with almost no arbitrage opportunities. With the Swiss National Bank and 39;s stated commitment to enforce the barrier, traders and 39; anticipation of this action leads to a vanishing drift together with a volatility of the exchange rate that depends on the distance to the barrier. This effect is described by Krugman and 39;s model [P. R. Krugman, Target zones and exchange rate dynamics, Q. J. Econ. 106, 669 (1991)]. We present direct quantitative empirical evidence that Krugman and 39;s theoretical model provides an accurate description of the euro1Swiss franc target zone. Motivated by the insights from the economic model, we revise the initial economics-physics analogy and show that, within the context of hindered diffusion, the two systems can be described with the same mathematics after all. Using a recently proposed extended analogy in terms of a colloidal Brownian particle embedded in a fluid of molecules associated with the underlying order book, we derive that, close to the restricting boundary, the dynamics of both systems is described by a stochastic differential equation with a very small constant drift and a linear diffusion coefficient. As a side result, we present a simplified derivation of the linear hydrodynamic diffusion coefficient of a Brownian particle close to a wall.},

The first shock accounts for virtually all of the variation in consumption; we argue that it can be plausibly interpreted as a permanent total factor productivity shock. The second shock, which underlies the vast bulk of quarterly fluctuations in labor income growth, permanently reallocates rewards between shareholders and workers but leaves consumption unaffected. Over the last 25 years, the cumulative effect of this shock has persistently boosted stock market wealth and persistently lowered labor earnings. We call this a factors share shock. The third shock is a persistent but transitory innovation that accounts for the vast majority of quarterly fluctuations in asset values but has a negligible impact on consumption and labor earnings at all horizons. We call this an exogenous risk aversion shock. We show that the 2000-02 asset market crash and recession surrounding it was characterized by a negative transitory wealth (positive risk aversion) shock, predominantly affecting stock market wealth. By contrast, the 2007-09 crash and recession was characterized by a string of large negative productivity shocks, as well as positive risk aversion shocks.},

The tail distributions of the returns satisfy a power law for developed markets but show a dual power-law structure for emerging markets. Prominent dual fractal structures are found during the plunging stage in developed markets, and after the plunging stage in emerging markets. The fractal analysis on the sign series of the returns yields similar dual fractal properties. The magnitude series of the returns provides surprising results during a crash. We find that developed markets have strong and weak long-range persistence in plunging and soaring stage respectively, while emerging markets behave oppositely.

Tests on residuals show a remarkable, low rate (0.2 of false positives when applied to a GARCH benchmark. When tested on the SandP 500 US index from Jan. 3, 1950 to Nov. 21, 2008, the model correctly identifies the bubbles ending in Oct. 1987, in Oct. 1997, and in Aug. 1998 and the ITC bubble ending on the first quarter of 2000. Different unit-root tests confirm the high relevance of the model specification. Our model also provides a diagnostic for the duration of bubbles: applied to the period before the Oct. 1987 crash, there is clear evidence that the bubble started at least 4 years earlier. We confirm the validity and universality of the volatility-confined LPPL model on seven other major bubbles that have occurred in the World in the last two decades. Using Bayesian inference, we find a very strong statistical preference for our model compared with a standard benchmark, in contradiction with Chang and Feigenbaum (2006) which used a unit-root model for residuals.},

We introduce a simple dynamics of the time horizon used by the representative investor, which is motivated by the race of trend following agents to forerun their competitors. We provide the full set of solutions, which includes an explosive regime where the price and momentum explodes stochastically in finite time to infinity, transient price dynamics escaping to infinity and recurrent behaviors, where the momentum remains either strictly positive or undergoes instantaneous reflections at the origin. The proposed price generating process produces price dynamics that are in agreement with the main qualitative properties of empirical financial time series. Moreover, it produces realistic regime shifts between non bubble and bubble regimes. We construct a quasi-likelihood methodology to calibrate the model to empirical financial time series, which is applied to an Internet index and a and mortar index, over the period of the dotcom bubble and its subsequent crash, from Jan. 1998 to Dec. 2002. The Wilks test of nested hypotheses shows a very strong skill in diagnosing the bubble of the Internet index and in disqualifying a bubble in the and mortar index.},

This paper shows how new financial derivatives, referred to here as crash options, could be used to protect investors' portfolios during periods of extreme volatility against a sharp, large decline in the position value. A detailed empirical study is carried out for the US stock market using a database of daily return covering the period 1885-1999.

  abstract       = {The rise of Big Data (BD) [13] and Data Science (DS) [14] along the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2009 as well as the multiple Flash Crashes of the early 2010s resulted in social uproars in the general population and ethical malaises in the scientific community [15, 7, 9, 8] which triggered noticeable changes in Quantitative Finance (QF). More specifically, QF was instructed to change [16, 17, 18] and become more realistic as opposed to more convenient. In terms of redefining the new models, we saw a significant wave favouring Machine Learning (ML) to take the leadership from Analysis and Probability Theory, a branch of the applied mathematical and computational sciences commonly known as traditional Mathematical Finance (MF) models. In this context we show how ML can allow us to completely revolutionize QF and how these changes of approach are as much mind boggling as too theoretical at this stage. But we will also see that ML can allow us to still enhance, transition out of, or rather add on to traditional MF for more practical, practitioners friendly models for a more realistic approach to QF. In this dual context, we introduce a revolutionary bottom up approach to algorithmic trading (AT) in the form of an original ecosystem of strategies [2]. We also continue opposing the two fields by introducing new methodologies to capture a broader elements of risk whether through harder science methodologies such as with Particle Filter (PF) [1] or via softer science approach through Psychology [7] taking as inspirational roots some of the common limitations of Reinforcement Learning and over-fitting in general. However the core of our original contribution is centered around reconciling the two fields and therefore apposing them. More specifically we take a look at few more humble DS and BD related problems such as exposing the risk associated to Cointelated pairs [9, 8] or in the context of their pairs trading [3]. We also address few Implied Volatility (IV) related problems like Anomaly Detection [10], Risk Factor Decomposition [11], Normalization [4], Reconciliation [5] and also see how BD is changing the way IV is modeled [6].},

Using finite sample simulation methods, we assess the power of long-horizon predictive tests and compare them to their short-run counterparts, when the true underlying model contains financial asset bubbles. Our results indicate that long-run predictive tests using valuation predictors - specifically the dividend price ratio - do pick up the in-sample return predictability inherent in the asset bubbles. However, after size-adjustment, the long-run predictive framework has little advantage over its short-run counterpart when the predictor is highly persistent, but can provide non-trivial, yet still modest, power improvements when the predictor is moderately persistent. Finally, we provide a brief intuitive explanation for why a model with temporary collapsing bubbles may yield in-sample predictive power without implying the existence of profitable out-of-sample trading strategies.},

This leads to a q-quantile approach (instead of a worst-case), which is a Value at Risk-style approach in the optimal portfolio problem with respect to the potential crash. Finally, it will be shown that --- under suitable conditions --- every stochastic portfolio strategy has at least one superior deterministic portfolio strategy within this approach.},

We show how markets are driven towards a make-or-break predatory dynamic that creates winners and losers due in part to weak regulations and identify a constant k that permeates market behaviours.},

The PPE results from an interplay between agents acting in a volatile market that is characterized by predatory behaviors. Prior to the 2008 subprime crisis, average investors are assumed to have displaced their logical PPEs in large part as a consequence of their attraction towards predatory mortgages and teaser rates. A better understanding of average investor's vulnerabilities may help governments to implement more efficient measures aimed at curving predatory behaviors.},

They have become more frequent in recent times as global wealth, the variety of assets being traded, and the mobility and velocity of capital have increased. Although the asset classes involved have changed over time, many of the key drivers and characteristics of bubbles remain the same. And yet markets appear to remain highly susceptible to them-indeed, much of the blame for the current crisis has been put on the bubble in housing. This article explains why asset bubbles occur and what investors can learn from them. It first examines how asset bubbles are formed and why it is critical that investors understand them. Next it examines the economic reasons for the inter-temporal increase in asset bubbles. In the third section, the authors conduct an empirical experiment to evaluate if they can predict asset bubbles, using the technology bubble as an example. The following section discusses the impact of bubbles on both active and passive equity investment strategies. The article concludes with some insights into how both active and passive strategies should be conditioned to address the perverse effects of asset bubbles.},

Such models assume that the tail behavior is constant for all observations. However, the extreme behavior of financial returns often changes considerably in time and such changes occur by sudden shocks of the market. Here we extend the extreme value mixture model class to formally take into account distributional extreme changepoints, by allowing for the presence of regime-dependent parameters modelling the tail of the distribution. This extension formally uses the full dataset to both estimate the thresholds and the extreme changepoint locations, giving uncertainty measures for both quantities. Estimation of functions of interest in extreme value analyses is performed via MCMC algorithms. Our approach is evaluated through a series of simulations, applied to real data sets and assessed against competing approaches. Evidence demonstrates that the inclusion of different extreme regimes outperforms both static and dynamic competing approaches in financial applications.},

  abstract       = {Internet of things (IoT) applications have become increasingly popular in recent years, with applications ranging from building energy monitoring to personal health tracking and activity recognition. In order to leverage these data, automatic knowledge extraction - whereby we map from observations to interpretable states and transitions - must be done at scale. As such, we have seen many recent IoT data sets include annotations with a human expert specifying states, recorded as a set of boundaries and associated labels in a data sequence. These data can be used to build automatic labeling algorithms that produce labels as an expert would. Here, we refer to human-specified boundaries as breakpoints. Traditional changepoint detection methods only look for statistically-detectable boundaries that are defined as abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. However, we observe that breakpoints occur on more subtle boundaries that are non-trivial to detect with these statistical methods. In this work, we propose a new unsupervised approach, based on deep learning, that outperforms existing techniques and learns the more subtle, breakpoint boundaries with a high accuracy. Through extensive experiments on various real-world data sets - including human-activity sensing data, speech signals, and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity traces - we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for practical applications. Furthermore, we show that our approach achieves significantly better performance than previous methods.},

  abstract             = {Many real-world networks are complex dynamical systems, where both local (e.g., changing node attributes) and global (e.g., changing network topology) processes unfold over time. Local dynamics may provoke global changes in the network, and the ability to detect such effects could have profound implications for a number of real-world problems. Most existing techniques focus individually on either local or global aspects of the problem or treat the two in isolation from each other. In this paper we propose a novel network model that simultaneously accounts for both local and global dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at modeling and detecting local and global change points on dynamic networks via a unified generative framework. Our model is built upon the popular mixed membership stochastic blockmodels (MMSB) with sparse co-evolving patterns. We derive an efficient stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) sampler for our proposed model, which allows it to scale to potentially very large networks. Finally, we validate our model on both synthetic and real-world data and demonstrate its superiority over several baselines.},

It is examined whether DAA is most profitable when based on changes in the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index or change points detected in daily returns of the S\&P 500 index. In an asset universe consisting of the S\&P 500 index and cash, it is shown that a dynamic strategy based on detected change points significantly improves the Sharpe ratio and reduces the drawdown risk when compared with a static, fixed-weight benchmark.},

Therefore, the expected illiquidity premium displays strong state-dependent variations that are countercyclical.

Our findings indicate that a negative relation between equity market returns and volatility prevails even after having controlled for the time-varying determinants of conditional volatility within each regime. We also find an asymmetry in the effect of price range on intra- and inter-regime return volatility. While price range has a stronger effect in the high volatility state, it appears to significantly affect only the transition probabilities when the stock market is in the low volatility state but not in the high volatility state. Finally, we provide evidence consistent with the 'rebound' model of asset returns proposed by Samuelson (1991), suggesting that long-horizon investors are expected to invest more in risky assets than short-horizon investors. We propose a two-state Markov-switching model for stock market returns. We examine the predictive power of price range and trading volume for volatility. Negative relation between return and volatility prevails under the proposed model. There are asymmetries in the effects of price range on return volatility.

We show that the optimal portfolio is a generalisation of the corresponding one in the classical Merton case, with portfolio proportions which depend on the market regime. We perform our analysis via the classical approach with the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation. First we extend the mutual fund theorem as presented in [5] to our framework. Then we show explicit solutions for the optimal strategies in the particular cases of exponential, logarithm and power utility functions.},

However, during currencies or global financial crashes, CT produces substantial losses. In this work we present a methodology that enhances CT performance significantly. For our final strategy, constructed backtests show that the mean-semivolatility ratio can be more than doubled with respect to benchmark CT. To do the latter, we first identify and classify CT returns according to their behavior in different regimes, using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The model helps to determine when to open and close positions, depending whether the regime is favorable to CT or not. Finally we employ a mean-semivariance allocation model to improve allocations when positions are opened.},

  abstract             = {This issue looks at a number of studies of regime-switching in financial markets; a hardy perennial of a research topic, much loved by academics and central bankers, but rather underused by practitioners. The reasons for this unpopularity are many. These reasons are not based on ignorance but on very real difficulties in implementation. Furthermore, the structure of these models sits uncomfortably with the assumptions made by conventional optimisers. Converting these regime structures into global stock selection models with universes of, say, 5000 stocks seems not to be currently feasible.

The first paper, by Bulla and co-authors, looks at a Markov-switching asset allocation model, which uses current information on volatility to adjust the market exposure. They show that, compared with buy-and-hold, there are increased returns and reduced volatility. The second paper, by Guidolin and Ria, converts regime-switching in first and second moments into regime-switching in mean variance frontiers. The data used here are Morgan Stanley investable indices for five countries/regions. The third article, by Haque, provides a theoretical contribution, in that it generalises the famous Barberis and Shleifer model of style switching. It is known that this model leads to small order ARMA models in relative style returns and current research looks at this structure as a way of forecasting when the switch may occur. This paper, by focusing on leaders and followers, may help in forecasting style switching and lead to new implementations of dynamic style allocation. The final paper, by van Vliet and Blitz, looks at asset allocation across different phases in the business cycle and identifies four phases, expressible in terms of time variation and risk and returns.

Concluding this issue provides a thorough examination of current research ideas on regime-switching. A point that comes through three of the papers very clearly is that, if we can implement regime-switching successfully, it is going to be with respect to asset classes or a small number of factors. For those of our readers who may wish to apply these ideas to stock selection models, it is clear that the only way forward is to regime-switch some of the key factors in the model. If a typical model has as factors market indices, style variables and possibly statistical factors, then it is not clear as yet which of these should be the most important ones for regime-switching. This may be a good topic for future research},

  abstract             = {One of the greatest challenges investors face is finding an investment strategy that provides competitive returns while reducing downside risk in both stable and changing market environments.

The past two decades have shown the limitations of traditional, static portfolio approaches and the weakness of diversification alone as a loss protection strategy. Many investors found that their supposedly diversified portfolios had correlations that moved to one in times of crisis and fell in lockstep. On the other hand, excessive caution over asset allocation in more favorable markets may well equate to less upside participation, also leading to a less than optimal return.

But what if a strategy could help reduce a portfolio's risk exposure before a downside event took place? What if a strategy could continually and dynamically re-allocate assets for optimal returns? Is there a reliable way of determining safer market conditions in which it makes more sense to invest more heavily in aggressive assets, providing optimized growth?

We think there is.

Look Forward, Not Backward

We've found that recent crises have caused many investors to ask what they could have done differently and to consider if there were signals, triggers or data points that may have foreshadowed the chaos that followed. They're looking to avoid damaging downsides but also to time increasing their market participation at the most favorable times. We recognized that retro-fitting signals from previous crises and opportunities may not mean that we will spot the next ones.

So, we set out to build a framework that had effective signaling power across a number of prior events, while also recognizing the need to continually adjust its influences over time.

Our goal was to develop and design a market-aware framework and dynamic investment process that would give us a systematic approach for identifying market environments and which used forward-looking factors to indicate which type of environment the market was moving into.},

The model is evaluated in an out-of-sample period of the last three years with a moving window and a forecast of only one period.

Results indicate that it is both possible and practical to develop a regime-based investing approach that can potentially add value over time. Success depends on identifying key factors that influence asset class performance, and then developing a way to model those non-linear relationships. Regime-based investing also requires a healthy degree of economic forecasting skill, which need not be perfect to add value.

We firstly model long memory and regime switching via the Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) and Markov Regime-Switching (MRS) models, respectively. Their finite-sample properties and the confusion are investigated via simulations. To control for the cause of this confusion, we propose the MRS ARFIMA model. A Monte Carlo study shows that this framework can effectively distinguish between the pure ARFIMA and pure MRS processes. Furthermore, MRS ARFIMA outperforms the ordinary ARFIMA model for data simulated from the MRS ARFIMA process. Finally, empirical studies of hourly and five-minute Garman Klass and realized volatility of the FTSE index is conducted to demonstrate the advantages and usefulness of the proposed MRS ARFIMA framework compared with the ARFIMA and MRS models in practice.},

  abstract             = {A rich literature supports the existence of both positive and negative relationship between the risk and return in the developed equity markets. However, the present study attempts to capture the risk-return relationship in the most promising and opportunities-instilled emerging market club, the "BRIC" equity markets, by employing a Markov regime switching model with time-varying transition probabilities, further taking St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (the US financial market stress) as an economic variable. The weekly benchmark index values are used in the analysis, spanning from the year 2004 to 2013. The results report the existence of time-varying transition probabilities with respect to the Brazilian and Indian markets only and fixed transition probabilities for the other countries undertaken. The Markov results support the existence of two regimes, wherein regime-1 reports a positive risk-return relationship, and regime-2 reports a negative relationship between the risk and return. Ironically, the Chinese equity market is found to be the riskiest but a perfect hedge instrument amongst others, considering its risk-return interactions in both the regimes. Furthermore, a lower level of financial stress in the US financial market is associated with a higher probability of remaining in the "Bullish" regime-1 in the Indian market as well as Brazilian market. Moreover, there is a positive co-movement between the US financial stress and the expected time-varying duration of remaining in the "Bearish" regime. This shows that due to the growing interdependence among the worldwide economies, a financial stress in one economy does have an impact on the other markets and risk-return relationship in their equity markets. An understanding of the risk-return dynamics coupled with the impact of exogenous variables is an imperative task that a portfolio manager must undertake so as to justify and manage the investments made in the equity markets.},

There are two key issues in long-term strategic asset allocation, namely, the presence of inflation risk and the impact of changes in (macro)-economic conditions on model dynamics. In this article, we take into account the two key issues in our model formulation and develop a quantitative model for long-term strategic asset allocation. A continuous-time, regime-switching market with the presence of inflation risk is considered. There are three tradeable assets in the market, namely, a fixed interest security, an ordinary share and an inflation-linked bond. We assume that the nominal rate of interest on the fixed interest security, the expected rate of return from the ordinary share and the appreciation rate of inflation are modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state, hidden Markov chain. The states of the chain represent different states of an economy. With knowledge about the price of the ordinary share and the price index level, an investor wishes to maximize the expected utility of real terminal wealth. By making use of the separation principle, we solve the optimal portfolio selection problem and the estimation problem independently. We derive a robust estimate of the hidden state of the chain and develop a robust, filter-based, EM algorithm for the on-line recursive estimates of the key model parameters.},

The findings reveal that the economic value of accounting for regimes is substantially independent of whether or not model and parameter uncertainties are incorporated: the certainty-equivalent losses associated with ignoring regime switching are generally above 2 percent per year, and can be as high as 10 percent.

These results suggest that the more realistic regime switching model is fundamentally different from the commonly used single-state model, and hence should be employed instead in portfolio decisions irrespective of concerns about model or parameter uncertainty.},

The latent-class models aim here to identify time-varying regimes within a dataset. This is of particular interest for geophysical processes driven by the seasonal variability. As a case example, we study the daily concentration of mineral suspended particulate matters estimated from satellite-derived datasets, in coastal waters adjacent to the French Gironde river mouth. We forecast this high-resolution dataset using environmental data (wave height, wind strength and direction, tides, and river outflow) and four latent-regime models: homogeneous and nonhomogeneous Markov-switching models, with and without an autoregressive term (i.e., the mineral suspended matter concentration observed the day before). Using a validation dataset, significant improvements are observed with the multiregime models compared to a classical multiregression and a state-of-the-art nonlinear model [support vector regression (SVR) model]. The best results are reported for a mixture of three regimes for the autoregressive model using nonhomogeneous transitions. With the autoregressive models, we obtain at day+1 for the mixture model forecasting performances of 93 percent of the explained variance, compared to 83 percent for a standard linear model and 85 percent using an SVR. These improvements are more important for the nonautoregressive models. These results stress the potential of the identification of geophysical regimes to improve the forecasting. We also show that nonhomogeneous transition probabilities and estimated autoregressive terms improve forecasting performances when observation data is lacking for short-time period of 1-15 days.},

Gaussian mixture variables is also considered.

The models are tested on empirical data and compared to a benchmark, assuming i.i.d. normally distributed returns. The results show that in a mean variance framework, the use of regime switching can improve risk and performance measures. The importance of the sensitivity of optimal portfolio weights to the estimate of the probability of the distressed regime is discussed, and methods for calculating sensitivities are presented and illustrated on market data.},

Here, we choose financial market as an example of a complex system, and do a comparative analyses of two stock markets - the S\&P 500 (USA) and Nikkei 225 (JPN). Our analyses are based on the evolution of crosscorrelation structure patterns of short time-epochs for a 32-year period (1985-2016). We identify "market states" as clusters of similar correlation structures, which occur more frequently than by pure chance (randomness). The dynamical transitions between the correlation structures reflect the evolution of the market states. Power mapping method from the random matrix theory is used to suppress the noise on correlation patterns, and an adaptation of the intra-cluster distance method is used to obtain the "optimum" number of market states. We find that the USA is characterized by four market states and JPN by five. We further analyze the co-occurrence of paired market states; the probability of remaining in the same state is much higher than the transition to a different state. The transitions to other states mainly occur among the immediately adjacent states, with a few rare intermittent transitions to the remote states. The state adjacent to the critical state (market crash) may serve as an indicator or a "precursor" for the critical state and this novel method of identifying the long-term precursors may be very helpful for constructing the early warning system in financial markets, as well as in other complex systems.},

These procedures are useful as warning alerts in surveillance strategies conducted by central banks and fiscal regulators with real-time data. Use of these methods over long historical periods presents a more serious econometric challenge due to the complexity of the nonlinear structure and break mechanisms that are inherent in multiple-bubble phenomena within the same sample period. To meet this challenge, this article develops a new recursive flexible window method that is better suited for practical implementation with long historical time series. The method is a generalized version of the sup augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test of Phillips et al. ( Explosive behavior in the 1990s NASDAQ: When did exuberance escalate asset values? International Economic Review 52 (2011), 201 26; PWY) and delivers a consistent real-time date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles. Simulations show that the test significantly improves discriminatory power and leads to distinct power gains when multiple bubbles occur. An empirical application of the methodology is conducted on S\&P 500 stock market data over a long historical period from January 1871 to December 2010. The new approach successfully identifies the well-known historical episodes of exuberance and collapses over this period, whereas the strategy of PWY and a related cumulative sum (CUSUM) dating procedure locate far fewer episodes in the same sample range.},

The model applies equally well to the question of when to enter and exit a short position. In this article, the authors test the model in two technology markets. These include the price of Apple computer stock from various times in 2009-2012 after the local low of March 6, 2009, plus a market in which the generally very successful bubble trader George Soros lost money by shorting the NASDAQ-100 stock index too soon in 2000.

By using the formalism of dynamical system theory, we explain what drives the bubbles and how foreshocks or aftershocks are generated. A dynamical phase space representation of that system coupled with standard multiplicative noise rationalises the log-periodic power law singularity pattern documented in many historical financial bubbles. The notion of 'ghosts of finite-time singularities' is introduced and used to estimate the end of an evolving bubble, using finite-time singularities of an approximate normal form near the bifurcation point. We test the forecasting skill of this method on different stochastic price realisations and compare with Monte Carlo simulations of the full system. Remarkably, the former is significantly more precise and less biased. Moreover, the method of ghosts of singularities is less sensitive to the noise realisation, thus providing more robust forecasts.},

  abstract             = {We define a financial bubble as a period of unsustainable growth, when the price of an asset increases ever more quickly, in a series of accelerating phases of corrections and rebounds.

More technically, during a bubble phase, the price follows a faster-than-exponential power law growth process, often accompanied by log-periodic oscillations. This dynamic ends abruptly in a change of regime that may be a crash or a substantial correction. Because they leave such specific traces, bubbles may be recognised in advance, that is, before they burst.

In this paper, we will explain the mechanism behind financial bubbles in an intuitive way. We will show how the log-periodic power law emerges spontaneously from the complex system that financial markets are, as a consequence of feedback mechanisms, hierarchical structure and specific trading dynamics and investment styles.

We argue that the risk of a major correction, or even a crash, becomes substantial when a bubble develops towards maturity, and that it is therefore very important to find evidence of bubbles and to follow their development from as early a stage as possible.

The tools that are explained in this paper actually serve that purpose. They are at the core of the Financial Crisis Observatory at the ETH Zurich, where tens of thousands of assets are monitored on a daily basis. This allow us to have a continuous overview of emerging bubbles in the global financial markets.

The companion report available as part of the Notenstein white paper series (2014) with the title ``Financial bubbles: mechanism, diagnostic and state of the World (Feb. 2014)'' presents a practical application of the methodology outlines in this article and describes our view of the status concerning positive and negative bubbles in the financial markets, as of the end of January 2014.},

This new context has features from prediction markets that have been shown previously to mitigate price bubbles in classical asset market experiments. Our setup is more realistic as it offers multiple securities that are continuously traded over days and, importantly, there is no true underlying price. Nonetheless, the market is designed such that its rationality can be evaluated. Quick consensus emerges early yielding pronounced market bubbles. The overpricing diminishes over time, indicating learning, but does not disappear completely. Traders' price estimates become progressively more independent via a collective realization of communal ignorance, pushing the market much closer to rationality, with forecasts that are close to the realized outcomes.},

Some researchers and finance practitioners believe that historical and/or implied volatility increase before a crash, but we do not see this as a consistent behavior. We examine forty well-known bubbles and, using creative graphical representations to capture robustly the transient dynamics of the volatility, find that the dynamics of the volatility would not have been a useful predictor of the subsequent crashes. In approximately two-third of the studied bubbles, the crash follows a period of lower volatility, reminiscent of the idiom of a "lull before the storm". This paradoxical behavior, from the lenses of traditional asset pricing models, further questions the general relationship between risk and return.},

Using a generalized Metcalfe's law based on network properties, a fundamental value is quantified and shown to be heavily exceeded, on at least four occasions, by bubbles that grow and burst. In these bubbles, we detect a universal super-exponential unsustainable growth. We model this universal pattern with the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, which parsimoniously captures diverse positive feedback phenomena, such as herding and imitation. The LPPLS model is shown to provide an ex-ante warning of market instabilities, quantifying a high crash hazard and probabilistic bracket of the crash time consistent with the actual corrections; although, as always, the precise time and trigger (which straw breaks the camel's back) being exogenous and unpredictable. Looking forward, our analysis identifies a substantial but not unprecedented overvaluation in the price of bitcoin, suggesting many months of volatile sideways bitcoin prices ahead (from the time of writing, March 2018).},

In both bilateral and global environments, multivariate skew-Student density has better predictive accuracy than normal density.

In global crash probability forecasts, multivariate skew-Student density attains much higher hit rate and Kuipers score than multivariate normal density, thus it can be used to improve early-warning systems.},

The LPPL model considers the faster-than-exponential (power law with finite-time singularity) increase in asset prices decorated by accelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles. It embodies a positive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative feedback spirals of crash expectations. The power of the LPPL model is illustrated by two recent real-life predictions performed recently by our group: the peak of the Oil price bubble in early July 2008 and the burst of a bubble on the Shanghai stock market in early August 2009. We then present the concept of negative bubbles , which are the mirror images of positive bubbles. We argue that similar positive feedbacks are at work to fuel these accelerated downward price spirals. We adapt the LPPL model to these negative bubbles and implement a pattern recognition method to predict the end times of the negative bubbles, which are characterized by rebounds (the mirror images of crashes associated with the standard positive bubbles). The out-of-sample tests quantified by error diagrams demonstrate the high significance of the prediction performance.},

We also compare the DS LPPLS method to the exponential curve fitting and the generalized sup ADF test approaches and find that DS LPPLS system is more accurate in identifying well-known bubble events, with significantly smaller numbers of false negatives and false positives.},

This approach also automatically deals with the common ancestral path dependence problem faced in these type volatility models. The model is tested on Borsa Istanbul (BIST) formerly known as Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) market data using daily log returns. A full structural changepoint specification is defined in which all parameters of the conditional variance of the volatility models are dynamic.

A large amount of methodologies has been developed on this topic, including ARIMA, Holt-Winters, etc. However, their performance is easily undermined by the existence of change points and anomaly points, two structures commonly observed in real data, but rarely considered in the aforementioned methods. In this paper, we propose a novel state space time series model, with the capability to capture the structure of change points and anomaly points, as well as trend and seasonality. To infer all the hidden variables, we develop a Bayesian framework, which is able to obtain distributions and forecasting intervals for time series forecasting, with provable theoretical properties. For implementation, an iterative algorithm with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Kalman filter and Kalman smoothing is proposed. In both synthetic data and real data applications, our methodology yields a better performance in time series forecasting compared with existing methods, along with more accurate change point detection and anomaly detection.},

  abstract     = {One of the bedrocks of modern capital market theory is that market risk and related statistics are stable over the long run. Nobel prizes have been won for this insight, and it is taught in the best business schools. Regulations have also been written based upon this assumption. Yet, experience does not support this idea. We know that often markets have periods of relative stability, but they can also be followed by years where it seems that all is chaos (and not in the physics sense of the word). In academia, there are theories that compete with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the main proponent of stable markets, but these competing theories are generally considered impractical since they don't lend themselves to easy solutions. The answers we often receive from the usable models, however, go horribly wrong when markets go south. Could it be that we're using those models simply because the light is better here? But how can we use the models that are impractical? In this paper, we show convincing evidence that there are actually two separate market states, each corresponding to these competing models. In essence, the CAPM and its critics are both right, but only part of the time. The implications from this for asset allocation and plan management are profound. There will be periods where using standard techniques for asset allocation or investment management will work well. When the environment changes, however, those processes may no longer work with reliability. This is particularly true of diversifi cation because assets that diversify one another in one state fail in the other state when they are truly needed. The rules change, and if investors hope to adapt successfully, they will need to know the new rules when the change occurs. This paper offers an explanation for that problem - two different market states causing assets to behave very differently. A subsequent paper will provide a roadmap to help asset owners anticipate and navigate deftly through the changes in market states.},

We demonstrate that this procedure successfully classifies different states of the markets in an unsupervised manner. In particular, we describe an experiment with one hundred log-returns and two states in which the methodology automatically associates one state to periods with average positive returns and the other state to periods with average negative returns, therefore discovering spontaneously the common classification of `bull' and `bear' markets. In another experiment, with again one hundred log-returns and two states, we demonstrate that this procedure can be efficiently used to forecast off-sample future market states with significant prediction accuracy. This methodology opens the way to a range of applications in risk management and trading strategies where the correlation structure plays a central role.},

We find clear evidence of cyclical variations in the three premiums, most notable being that in the size premium, which changes from positive in expansions to negative in recessions. Macroeconomic indicators prompting such cyclicality the most are variables that proxy credit market conditions, namely the interest rates, term structure and credit spread. Overall, macro factors tend to have more significant impact on the three premiums during economic downturns. The results are robust to the choice of information variable used in modelling transition probabilities of the two-stage Markov switching model. We show that exploiting cyclicality in premiums proves particularly profitable for portfolios featuring small cap stocks in recessions at a feasible level of transaction costs.},

  abstract       = {Hedge fund replication has become a cottage industry in investing. Among the most popular hedge fund replication frameworks are factor models based on ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, a development that is no doubt due to its simplicity and familiarity among investment practitioners. Despite their widespread use, the OLS regression-based factor models that form the basis for many hedge fund replication programs are often overfitted to a single sample, severely undercutting their predictive effectiveness. As a remedy to the latter shortcoming, in this article the authors apply the regularization method known as  regression to the replication of hedge fund strategies. Ridge regression works by formally imbuing a regression with additional bias in exchange for a reduction in the variance between training and test samples. Using a simple yet robust methodology, the authors show how to dynamically calibrate the predictively optimal level of bias without significantly reducing the backward-looking explanatory power of a given model. In doing so, the authors demonstrate that ridge regression can help produce generalizable models that are useful in both the ex post risk analysis and ex ante replication of hedge fund strategies.},

The roots of this less-than-enthusiastic uptake can be found in two familiar sources: models that possess an overly complex formal structure and poor predictive ability. As a remedy to the current state of affairs, the authors present a new foundation for regime-based investing, one based on spectral clustering, a graph theoretic approach to classifying data. Drawing inspiration from the work of Hyman Minsky and John Geanakoplos, the authors present a macro framework that uses measures of growth, inflation, and leverage to define regimes and drive portfolio decisions. To the latter end, the authors show how the framework can be used to build portfolios using information about regimes as defined, to outperform a no-information equal-weight portfolio both out-of-sample and in bootstrapped and cross-validated simulations. The authors thus show that spectral clustering can provide both an elegant mathematical description of the leverage cycle and a robust foundation for quant-macro investing.},

For this, we design an active macro risk-based framework that notably aims to exploit alternative risk premia's varying behavior in different macro regimes. We build long-term strategic portfolios across economic regimes, which we dynamically tilt based on point-in-time signals related to regimes nowcasting and current carry.

In an asset universe consisting of a global stock index and a global government bond index, they show that, even without any level of forecasting skill, holding a static portfolio may not be optimal.},

The control is based on multi-period forecasts of the mean and covariance of financial returns from a multivariate hidden Markov model with time-varying parameters. There are computational advantages to using model predictive control when estimates of future returns are updated every time new observations become available, because the optimal control actions are reconsidered anyway. Transaction and holding costs are discussed as a means to address estimation error and regularize the optimization problem. The proposed approach to multi-period portfolio selection is tested out of sample over two decades based on available market indices chosen to mimic the major liquid asset classes typically considered by institutional investors. By adjusting the risk aversion based on realized drawdown, it successfully controls drawdowns with little or no sacrifice of mean-variance efficiency. Using leverage it is possible to further increase the return without increasing the maximum drawdown.},

Combining forecasts from multiple temporal aggregation levels exploits information differences and mitigates model uncertainty, while reconciliation ensures a unified prediction that supports aligned decisions at different horizons. In previous studies, weights assigned to the forecasts were given by the structure of the hierarchy or the forecast error variances without considering potential autocorrelation in the forecast errors. Our first estimator considers the autocovariance matrix within each aggregation level. Since this can be difficult to estimate, we propose a second estimator that blends autocorrelation and variance information, but only requires estimation of the first-order autocorrelation coefficient at each aggregation level. Our third and fourth estimators facilitate information sharing between aggregation levels using robust estimates of the cross-correlation matrix and its inverse. We compare the proposed estimators in a simulation study and demonstrate their usefulness through an application to short-term electricity load forecasting in four price areas in Sweden. We find that by taking account of auto- and cross-covariances when reconciling forecasts, accuracy can be significantly improved uniformly across all frequencies and areas.},

While the recent literature on testing for change points in this context considers hypotheses for the equality of the means before and after the change points in the different components, we are interested in a null hypothesis with given thresholds for which a smaller difference of the means in the h-th component is considered to be non-relevant.

In particular, using Gaussian approximations for the maximum of a large number of dependent random variables, we show that on certain points of the boundary of the null hypothesis a standardised version of the maximum converges weakly to a Gumbel distribution.},

To this end, we consider a multiple mean change model with possible time series errors and prove that the number and location of change points are estimated consistently by this procedure. Additionally, we derive rates of convergence for the estimation of the location of the change points and show that these rates cannot be improved in general by deriving the limit distribution of properly scaled estimators under somewhat stronger assumptions. Because the small sample behavior depends crucially on how the asymptotic (long-run) variance of the error sequence is estimated, we propose to use moving sum type estimators for the (long-run) variance and derive their asymptotic properties. While they do not estimate the variance consistently at every point in time, they can still be used to consistently estimate the number and location of the changes. In fact, this inconsistency can even lead to more precise estimators for the change points. Finally, some simulations illustrate the behavior of the estimators in small samples.},

  abstract             = {Contemporary actuarial and accounting practices (APN 110 in the South African context) require the use of market-consistent models for the valuation of embedded investment derivatives. These models have to be calibrated with accurate and up-to-date market data. Arguably, the most important variable in the valuation of embedded equity derivatives is implied volatility. However, accurate long-term volatility estimation is difficult because of a general lack of tradable, liquid medium- and long-term derivative instruments, be they exchange-traded or over the counter. In South Africa, given the relatively short-term nature of the local derivatives market, this is of particular concern. This paper attempts to address this concern by (1) providing a comprehensive, critical evaluation of the long-term volatility models most commonly used in practice, encompassing simple historical volatility estimation and econometric, deterministic and stochastic volatility models; and (2) introducing several fairly recent nonparametric alternative methods for estimating long-term volatility, namely break-even volatility and canonical option valuation.

The authors apply these various models and methodologies to South African market data, thus providing practical, long-term volatility estimates under each modelling framework whilst accounting for real-world difficulties and constraints. In so doing, they identify those models and methodologies they consider to be most suited to long-term volatility estimation and propose best estimation practices within each identified area. Thus, while application is restricted to the South African market, the general discussion, as well as the suggestion of best practice, in each of the evaluated modelling areas remains relevant for all long-term volatility estimation.},

Unfortunately, estimating such return distributions is anything but trivial. In this research, we consider the information embedded in the derivatives market. Derivatives are forward-looking instruments by design and thus should contain forward-looking information about their underlying assets.We describe how forward-looking information on the statistical properties of an asset can be extracted directly from options market data and how this can be used practically in portfolio management. While the extraction of a forward-looking risk-neutral distribution is well-established in the literature, obtaining information on future real-world distributions was until recently thought to be impossible. However, recent work by Ross (2015) has shown that it is indeed possible to derive exactly this distribution purely from options market data. We describe a robust implementation of Ross's method on a history of weekly Top40 Index and USDZAR implied volatility surfaces. We outline some graphical ideas on how one can use this information descriptively and prescriptively and furthermore analyse the recovered moments - expected return, volatility, skewness and kurtosis - from the implied distributions. These recovered real-world moments are shown to be in line with economic rationale and also show promising results when used as signals within a simple TAA framework.},

We first outline a systematic process for creating a timed hedging strategy and then backtest how effective each of the proposed indicators are as hedge timing signals under real world market conditions. A total of 36 hedge timing indicators are tested using five common hedging structures. Detailed results and discussion are provided for each hedging structure. In general, the long-term timed hedge backtests show very promising results, producing timed hedged portfolios with returns as good or better than the index but with significantly lower volatility and tail risk.},

In this report, we provide an introduction to, and critique of, the factor investing paradigm in a South African setting. We initially discuss the general factor construction process at length and construct a comprehensive range of risk factors for the South African equity market according to international factor modelling standards. In this report, we focus on the size, value, momentum, profitability, investment, low volatility and low beta risk factors respectively. We critically examine the historical behaviour and robustness of these factors, paying particular attention to the issues of long-only versus long/short factors, the impact of size, the effect of rebalancing frequency and data, and the robustness of performance to alternative factor definitions.

We also review how these factors can be used generally in risk management and portfolio management. In the risk management space, we firstly consider risk attribution to factors and introduce the Factor Efficiency Ratio as a means of quantifying a fund's desired versus undesired factor exposure. Secondly, we consider returns-based style analysis as a means of identifying a fund's factor style mix and also as a method for replicating existing indices with long-only risk factors. In the portfolio management space, we discuss several approaches for creating multi-factor portfolios. We start by considering the simplest case of portfolio mixing, which allocates to a set of predefined factor building blocks. We then review the integrated scoring approach, which accounts for multiple factors within the scoring process directly. Finally, we consider a mixed integer programming optimisation approach, which allows an investor to construct an optimal multi-factor portfolio that is as consistent with their return objectives and risk preferences as their constraint set will permit.},

While the qualitative purpose of diversification is well-known, a satisfactory quantitative definition of portfolio diversification is not. In this report, we summarise a wide range of diversification measures, focussing our efforts on those most commonly used in practice. We categorise each measure based on which portfolio aspect it focusses on: cardinality, weights, returns, risk or higher moments. We then apply these measures to a range of South African equity indices, thus giving a diagnostic review of historical local equity diversification and, perhaps more importantly, providing a description of the investable opportunity set available to fund managers in this space. Finally, we introduce the idea of diversification profiles. These regime-dependent profiles give a much richer description of portfolio diversification than their single-value counterparts and also allow one to manage diversification proactively based on one's view of future market conditions.},

This has clear consequences for using generic index options to hedge highly active portfolios. We also showcase several active return and tracking error decompositions that allow one to precisely quantify and thus manage the sources of risk and rewards within a given portfolio. We then discuss a mixed integer quadratic programming formulation that enables us to search across a large investment universe in order to find the subset of stocks that most closely replicates a given portfolio's performance, whilst simultaneously complying with realistic market constraints. Motivated by these three elements, we introduce several alternative hedging methods for the fund manager to implement a better hedge for their active portfolio.

  abstract             = {This paper tackles a core question of portfolio management: How 'active' is an active portfolio? To answer this question holistically, we generalise the idea of active share by keeping the same calculation methodology but substituting in different types of portfolio and benchmark 'weights'. In particular, we introduce the idea of risk share - based on asset risk weights - and factor share - based on either factor style weights or factor risk weights. Used in combination, this trio of active share, risk share and factor share provides one with a far better understanding of how an active portfolio truly differs from its benchmark.

We introduce these metrics and describe their calculations in a general multi-factor market framework. Using a set of simulated random portfolios of increasing activeness, we then investigate the relationship between active share and future active return, and between active share, tracking error and risk share. From the simulation, we find that:

(i) active share is not a predictor of future active returns,

(ii) there is a convex relationship between active share and tracking error, in line with that given mathematically in the multi-factor framework, and

(iii) portfolios of equivalent active share can have materially different risk share values, particularly evident for moderately active portfolios.

Finally, we showcase factor share by conducting an analysis on a set of South African equity funds. We find that the level of factor activeness across the funds and over time varies greatly, and that the relationship between factor active share and factor risk share calculated from the empirical data is similar to the relationship between asset active share and asset risk share calculated from the simulated data.},

Therefore, having a flexible and robust estimation process is of crucial importance to all market participants. In this work we make use of the Flexible Probabilities framework and show how to incorporate different forms of time-conditioning and market state-conditioning into any estimation procedure. This framework allows one to calculate conditional risk and return statistics in a simple manner for a wide range of portfolio and risk management applications. We then make use of this framework in three applications which we believe to be directly relevant to South African market participants. Firstly, we address the long-standing issue of identifying rand-hedge stocks and quantifying the extent of their hedging ability, specifically in times of rand weakness and strength. Secondly, we examine whether the of diversification - that diversification disappears when one needs it most - holds true for South African markets. Finally, we extend the original returns-based style analysis framework to allow for time- and state-conditioned weights and estimate the style mix of the South African equity market across time and market regime.},

We compare these methods by new statistical and economic measures that take into account the latent nature of the market state. The statistical measure is based directly on the predictions, while the economic measure is based on the utility that results when a risk-averse agent uses the predictions in an investment decision.

Our application of this framework to the SandP 500 shows that rule-based methods are preferable for (in-sample) identification of the market state, but regime-switching models for (out-of-sample) forecasting. In-sample only the direction of the market matters, but for forecasting both means and volatilities of returns are important.

Stocks with high crash probability are overpriced regardless of the level of institutional ownership or variations in investor sentiment, and moreover, they exhibit increasing institutional demand until their prices reach the peak of overvaluation. We also find that institutional investors who overweight high crash probability stocks outperform the others, indicating that they have skill in timing bubbles and crashes of individual stocks. Our findings imply that sophisticated investors may not always trade against mispricing but time the correction of overpricing, and suggest that the crash effect we find could arise at least partially from rational speculative bubbles, not entirely from sentiment-driven overpricing.},

  abstract     = {The topic of extreme events is becoming ever more important for risk management. Stress testing is a technique that is explicitly designed to deal with extreme shocks; however, its methodology and place in the risk process is often unclear to risk managers.

This paper addresses some common misconceptions about stress testing and provides methodology for its incorporation into the risk process as a supplement to risk measures such as value-at-risk and tracking error. Two stress testing models are presented and empirically validated on actual extreme periods. Both are based on multivariate normal distributions conditional on a factor shock, differing only in the way that covariances are estimated. The first model uses temporal weighting commonly used in the risk model construction; the other uses event weighting, which assigns a higher weight to extreme events that are similar to the factor shock specified.

The key conclusion is that the time weighted model performs better in moderate or semi-expected shocks, while the event weighted model performs better in more extreme and unexpected shocks like the Long-Term Capital Management crisis, 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the Fall 2008 financials-led meltdown. The event weighted model, which is designed to reflect the rise in correlations and variances during extreme markets, produces a more conservative estimate of return impacts.

Our results support the conclusion that stress testing can be a very valuable addition to standard risk measures.},

We consider three Bayesian models that involve normal and Student's t-distributions in the disturbances and an AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) structure only within the first case. In the empirical part of the study, we analyze a well-known example of financial bubble the S\&P 500 1987 crash to show the usefulness of the three methods under consideration and crashes of Merval-94, Bovespa-97, IPCMX-94, Hang Seng-97 using the simplest method. The novelty of this research is that the Bayesian models provide 95 percent credible intervals for the estimated crash time.},

The use of the high's and low's of the bridge associated with the original process makes the estimators significantly more efficient that the standard realized variance estimators and its generalizations. Adding the information on the occurrence times of the high and low values improves further the efficiency of the estimators, much above those of the well-known realized variance estimator and those derived from the sum of Garman and Klass spot variance estimators. The exact analytical results are derived for the case where the underlying log-price process is an Ito stochastic process.

Following this understanding that asset price bubbles are generated by market failures, we present a framework for explosive semimartingales that is based on the antagonistic combination of (i) an excessive, unstable pre-crash process and (ii) a drawdown starting at some random time. This unifying framework allows one to accommodate and compare many discrete and continuous time bubble models in the literature that feature such market inefficiencies. Moreover, it significantly extends the range of feasible asset price processes during times of financial speculation and frenzy and provides a strong theoretical background for future model design in financial and risk management problem settings.This conception of bubbles also allows us to elucidate the status of rational expectation bubbles, which, by design, suffer from the paradox that a rational market should not allow for misvaluation. While the discrete time case has been extensively discussed in the literature and is most criticized for its failure to comply with rational expectations equilibria, we argue that this carries over to the finite time local martingale-approach to bubbles.Our framework will simplify and foster interdisciplinary exchange at the intersection of economics and mathematical finance and encourage further research.},

The external field is endogenised to represent a smoothed moving average of the past state variable. This model captures in a simple set-up the interplay between instantaneous social imitation and past trends in social coordinations. We show the existence of a rich set of bifurcations as a function of the two parameters quantifying the relative importance of instantaneous versus past social opinions on the formation of the next value of the state variable. Moreover, we present thorough analysis of chaotic behaviour, which is exhibited in certain parameter regimes. Finally, we examine several transitions through bifurcation curves and study how they could be understood as specific market scenarios. We find that the amplitude of the corrections needed to recover from a crisis and to push the system back to is often significantly larger than the strength of the causes that led to the crisis itself.},

Recent extensions in term of quantum decision theory are also covered. A wealth of models are discussed briefly that build on the Ising model and generalize it to account for the many stylized facts of financial markets. A summary of the relevance of the Ising model and its extensions is provided to account for financial bubbles and crashes. The review would be incomplete if it would not cover the dynamical field of agent based models (ABMs), also known as computational economic models, of which the Ising-type models are just special ABM implementations. We formulate the ``Emerging Market Intelligence hypothesis'' to reconcile the pervasive presence of ``noise traders'' with the near efficiency of financial markets. Finally, we note that evolutionary biology, more than physics, is now playing a growing role to inspire models of financial markets.},

However, this positive view should be balanced by the fact that this remains a very delicate and difficult field, if only due to the scarcity of data as well as the extraordinary important implications with respect to hazard assessment, risk control and predictability.},

  abstract             = {The financial crisis of 2008, which started with an initially well-defined epicenter focused on mortgage backed securities (MBS), has been cascading into a global economic recession, whose increasing severity and uncertain duration has led and is continuing to lead to massive losses and damage for billions of people. Heavy central bank interventions and government spending programs have been launched worldwide and especially in the USA and Europe, with the hope to unfreeze credit and boltster consumption.

Here, we present evidence and articulate a general framework that allows one to diagnose the fundamental cause of the unfolding financial and economic crisis: the accumulation of several bubbles and their interplay and mutual reinforcement has led to an illusion of a perpetual money machine allowing financial institutions to extract wealth from an unsustainable artificial process.

Taking stock of this diagnostic, we conclude that many of the interventions to address the so-called liquidity crisis and to encourage more consumption are ill-advised and even dangerous, given that precautionary reserves were not accumulated in the good times but that huge liabilities were.

The most interesting present times constitute unique opportunities but also great challenges, for which we offer a few recommendations.},

We investigated univariate classification performances of log-periodic parameters. These parameters appear to characterize investor behavior. Further, they enable us to draw conclusions of banks' refinancing options. We employ the log-periodic power law (LPPL) to analyze the late-2000 financial crisis from the perspective of critical phenomena. The main purpose of this study is to examine whether LPPL structures in the development of credit default swap (CDS) spreads can be used for default classification. Based on the different triggers of Bear Stearns' near bankruptcy during the late-2000 financial crisis and Ford's insolvency in 2009, this study provides a quantitative description of the mechanism behind bank runs. We apply the Johansen Ledoit Sornette (JLS) positive feedback model to explain the rise of financial institutions' CDS spreads during the global financial crisis 2007 2009. This investigation is based on CDS spreads of 40 major banks over the period from June 2007 to April 2009 which includes a significant CDS spread increase. The qualitative data analysis indicates that the CDS spread variations have followed LPPL patterns during the global financial crisis. Furthermore, the univariate classification performances of seven LPPL parameters as default indicators are measured by Mann Whitney U tests. The present study supports the hypothesis that discrete scale-invariance governs the dynamics of financial markets and suggests the application of new and fast updateable default indicators to capture the buildup of long-range correlations between creditors.},

After structuring the research questions, we collect the corresponding answers from the four articles. This eventually gives us an overall picture of the application of the LPPLS to credit risk data. Our literature review begins with grounding the view that credit default swap (CDS) spreads are hotbeds for LPPLS patterns and it ends up with drawing attention to the recently proposed alarm index for the prediction of institutional bank runs. By presenting a new field of application for the LPPLS, the reviewed strand of literature further substantiates the LPPLS hypothesis.

To model these negative bubbles, we adapt the Johansen Ledoit Sornette (JLS) model of rational expectation bubbles with a hazard rate describing the collective buying pressure of noise traders. The price fall occurring during a transient negative bubble can be interpreted as an effective random down payment that rational agents accept to pay in the hope of profiting from the expected occurrence of a possible rally. We validate the model by showing that it has significant predictive power in identifying the times of major market rebounds. This result is obtained by using a general pattern recognition method that combines the information obtained at multiple times from a dynamical calibration of the JLS model. Error diagrams, Bayesian inference and trading strategies suggest that one can extract genuine information and obtain real skill from the calibration of negative bubbles with the JLS model. We conclude that negative bubbles are in general predictably associated with large rebounds or rallies, which are the mirror images of the crashes terminating standard bubbles. Negative bubbles are in general predictably associated with large rebounds. The new model shows predictive power in identifying the time of market rebounds.

  abstract             = {Identifying unambiguously the presence of a bubble in an asset price remains an unsolved problem in standard econometric and financial economic approaches. A large part of the problem is that the fundamental value of an asset is, in general, not directly observable and it is poorly constrained to calculate. Further, it is not possible to distinguish between an exponentially growing fundamental price and an exponentially growing bubble price.

We present a series of new models based on the Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model, which is a flexible tool to detect bubbles and predict changes of regime in financial markets. Our new models identify the fundamental value of an asset price and crash nonlinearity from a bubble calibration.

In addition to forecasting the time of the end of a bubble, the new models can also estimate the fundamental value and the crash nonlinearity. Besides, the crash nonlinearity obtained in the new models presents a new approach to possibly identify the dynamics of a crash after a bubble.

We test the models using data from three historical bubbles ending in crashes from different markets. They are: the Hong Kong Hang Seng index 1997 crash, the S\&P 500 index 1987 crash and the Shanghai Composite index 2009 crash.

All results suggest that the new models perform very well in describing bubbles, forecasting their ending times and estimating fundamental value and the crash nonlinearity.

The performance of the new models is tested under both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian residual assumption. Under the Gaussian residual assumption, nested hypotheses with the Wilks statistics are used and the p-values suggest that models with more parameters are necessary. Under non-Gaussian residual assumption, we use a bootstrap method to get type I and II errors of the hypotheses.

All tests confirm that the generalized JLS models provide useful improvements over the standard JLS model.},

In consequence, the literature on bubbles and their detection is abundant, with many researchers taking very opposite positions on the topic, however. This survey gives a structured overview of the two branches of research that have received the most attention in bubble research. First, we describe the theoretical models that have been developed to model bubble phenomena. These can be divided into rational bubble models and behavioral bubble models. Second, we provide a structured overview of empirical methods for the detection of rational bubbles. We focus in particular on recently developed bubble detection methods, namely recursive unit root tests, fractional integration tests, and regime-switching tests. These tests are predominantly advanced stationarity and cointegration-based tests and as such are not based on the fundamental factors of the assets but rather focus on the time series of the asset prices. As a result, they avoid testing a joint hypothesis of the presence of rational bubbles and the validity of the model used to determine the asset value. Furthermore, they are capable of detecting multiple, periodically collapsing bubbles.While a consensus both on the appropriate theoretical bubble model as well as on the most applicable empirical bubble detection test has not been reached, especially empirical research has made significant progress. Different bubble detection tests now increasingly find overlapping evidence of rational bubbles when used to analyze the same time series. Nonetheless, many results are still inconclusive and bubbles remain an interesting avenue for further research.},

We account for the damping condition of LPPLS model in the search space and implement the stricter filter conditions for the qualification of the valid LPPLS fits by taking account of the maximum relative error, Lomb log-periodic test of the detrended residual, and unit-root tests of the logarithmic residual based on both the Phillips-Perron test and Dickey-Fuller test to improve the performance of LPPLS confidence indicator. Our analysis shows that the LPPLS detection strategy diagnoses the positive bubbles and negative bubbles corresponding to well-known historical events, implying the detection strategy based on the LPPLS confidence indicator has an outstanding performance to identify the bubbles in advance. We find that the probability density distribution of the estimated beginning time of bubbles appears to be skewed and the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the area where the bubbles start to have a super-exponentially growth. This study presents that it is possible to detect the potential positive and negative bubbles and crashes ahead of time, which provides a prerequisite for limiting the bubble sizes and eventually minimizing the damage from the bubble crash.},

The back tests of 2015 Chinese stock market bubbles indicates that the LPPLS model can readily detect the bubble behavior of the faster-than-exponential increase corrected by the accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations in the 2015 Chinese Stock market. The existence of log-periodicity is detected by applying the Lomb spectral analysis on the detrended residuals. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck property and the stationarity of the LPPLS fitting residuals are confirmed by the two Unit-root tests (Philips-Perron test and Dickery-Fuller test). According to our analysis, the actual critical day tc can be well predicted by the LPPLS model as soon as two months before the actual bubble crash. Compared to the traditional optimization method used in LPPLS model, the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) may have a significantly lower computation cost. The CMA-ES is recommended as an alternative algorithm in the LPPLS model. Moreover, the exponent m does not show a remarkable feature of change when the start day t1 is fixed while the end day t2 is moved towards the actual critical time tc in the expanding windows. In the LPPLS fitting with expanding windows, the gap (tc -t2) shows a significant decrease when the end day t2 approaches the actual bubble crash time. The change rate of the gap (tc -t2) may be used as an additional indicator besides of the key indicator tc to improve the prediction of bubble burst.},

  abstract       = {In the past decade, Bitcoin has become an emerging asset class well known to most people because of their extraordinary return potential in phases of extreme price growth and their unpredictable massive crashes. We apply the LPPLS confidence indicator as a diagnostic tool for identifying bubbles using the daily data of Bitcoin price in the past two years. We find that the LPPLS confidence indicator based on the daily data of Bitcoin price fails to provide effective warnings for detecting the bubbles when the Bitcoin price suffers from a large fluctuation in a short time, especially for positive bubbles. In order to diagnose the existence of bubbles and accurately predict the bubble crashes in the cryptocurrency market, this study proposes an adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology based on the LPPLS model. We adopt two levels of time series, 1 hour and 30 minutes, to demonstrate the adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology. The results show that the LPPLS confidence indicator based on the adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology have not only an outstanding performance to effectively detect the bubbles and accurately forecast the bubble crashes, but can also monitor the development and the crash of bubbles even if a bubble exists in a short time. In addition, we discover that the short-term LPPLS confidence indicator greatly affected by the extreme fluctuations of Bitcoin price can provide some useful insights into the bubble status on a shorter time scale, and the long-term LPPLS confidence indicator has a stable performance in terms of effectively monitoring the bubble status on a longer time scale. The adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology can provide real-time detection of bubbles and advanced forecast to warn of an imminent crash risk in not only the cryptocurrency market but also the other financial markets.},

We apply the general approach to the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model of financial bubbles. This model is particularly relevant because one of its parameters, the critical time signalling the burst of the bubble, is arguably the target of choice for dynamical risk management. However, previous calibrations of the LPPLS model have shown that the estimation of is in general quite unstable. Here, we provide a rigorous likelihood inference approach to determine , which takes into account the impact of the other nonlinear (so-called ?nuisance?) parameters for the correct adjustment of the uncertainty on . This provides a rigorous interval estimation for the critical time, rather than the point estimation in previous approaches. As a bonus, the interval estimates can also be obtained for the nuisance parameters (, damping), which can be used to improve filtering of the calibration results. We show that the use of the modified profile likelihood method dramatically reduces the number of local extrema by constructing much simpler smoother log-likelihood landscapes. The remaining distinct solutions can be interpreted as genuine scenarios that unfold as the time of the analysis flows, which can be compared directly via their likelihood ratio. Finally, we develop a multi-scale profile likelihood analysis to visualize the structure of the financial data at different scales (typically from 100 to 750 days). We test the methodology successfully on synthetic price time series and on three well-known historical financial bubbles.},

The aim of this paper is to present novel tests for the early causal diagnostic of positive and negative bubbles in the S\&P 500 index and the detection of End-of-Bubble signals with their corresponding confidence levels. We use monthly S\&P 500 data covering the period from August 1791 to August 2014. This study is the first work in the literature showing the possibility to develop reliable ex-ante diagnostics of the frequent regime shifts over two centuries of data. We show that the DS LPPLS (log-periodic power law singularity) approach successfully diagnoses positive and negative bubbles, constructs efficient End-of-Bubble signals for all of the well-documented bubbles, and obtains for the first time new statistical evidence of bubbles for some other events. We also compare the DS LPPLS method to the exponential curve fitting and the generalized sup ADF test approaches and find that DS LPPLS system is more accurate in identifying well-known bubble events, with significantly smaller numbers of false negatives and false positives.},

In addition to the fundamental macro-economic factors, this paper argues that the existence of herding behavior as well as the level of investor attention are also important factors affecting the pattern of stock price fluctuations. By differentiating the rational component and irrational component of these behavioral factors, more insight concerning financial crisis can be drawn.

Patterns of crashes are defined by three dimensions, which are the cumulative decline, the speed of decline, as well as the duration of the crash. Innovative measures and comprehensive analyses are conducted based on three sets of explanatory factors: macroeconomic factors, market micro-structure factors and behavioral factors. Results of partial R2 show that behavioral factors are the most influential factors explaining the magnitude as well as the duration of crash; while the speed of decline is mainly related to market micro-structure factor. Our results show that investors' irrational behavior is more important than fundamental factors in explaining or predicting market crashes.

The contribution of this study are threefold: First, crashes in 40 markets are defined, measured and categorized into eight types of crash patterns, providing interesting statistics for international market crashes. Secondly, we differentiate between rational and irrational components of behavioral factors in explaining the causes of market crashes, which are largely neglected in past literatures. Thirdly, threshold of each explanatory variable of market crash are estimated. The results of this paper can provide policy makers, fund managers and investors valuable information in risk management and pre-warning system.},

Moreover, they assume unbiased forecasts without explaining how the investors form their forecasts.

In this paper, we provide a model of asset price forecasts and market prices that can be calibrated with experimental data and that can capture various behavioural characteristics of investors such as confidence and panic. We study the resulting dynamical system and show that asset price bubbles may result from seemingly reasonable forecasts and decisions of investors. The model attempts to provide insight into the qualitative connection between investors forecasting behaviour and the formation of bubbles and cycles.

We present results on the convergence of the process to a fixed point, or to an attractor that describes a price cycle, or to long-run behaviour that seems unpredictable, and we consider where in the cycles most time is spent.},

We define a bubble as a period of unsustainable growth, when the price of an asset increases ever more quickly, in a series of accelerating phases of corrections and rebounds. More technically, during a bubble phase, the price follows a fasterthan- exponential power law growth process, often accompanied by log-periodic oscillations. This dynamic ends abruptly in a change of regime that may be a crash or a substantial correction.

In this paper, we will explain the mechanism behind financial bubbles in an intuitive way. We will show how the log-periodic power law emerges spontaneously from the complex system that financial markets are as a consequence of feedback mechanisms, hierarchical structure and specific trading dynamics and investment styles. We argue that the risk of a major correction, or even a crash, becomes substantial when a bubble develops towards maturity, and that it is therefore very important to find evidence of bubbles and to follow their development from as early a stage as possible.

We call for the establishment of Financial Crisis Observatories, like the FCO at the ETH Zurich, where financial markets can be monitored continuously for potential systemic risk, and where both generally accepted as well as innovative tools and models can be tested and challenged in a scientific way.},

  abstract     = {During the last decade, two deep bear markets, as results of tech bubble and mortgage crisis, have challenged the conventional wisdoms such as modern portfolio theory (MPT) and Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). As an alternative, the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis (AMH), proposed by Lo (2004, 2005, 2012), in which intelligent but fallible investors constantly adapt to changing market conditions, helps explain the importance of macro factors and market sentiment in driving asset returns.

In this paper, I examine some of the shortcomings of the MPT and EMH, as well as the drawbacks in their applications. More importantly, I introduce the framework of adaptive investment approach, under which investors can adjust their investments to reflect economic regimes, ongoing market return or market volatility. Some of the investment strategies such as regime-based investing, momentum strategy, trend following or risk parity fall into the framework.

This approach has the potential to deliver consistent returns in any market environments, by dynamically positioning in the financial assets perceived to have best return potential under the ongoing market and economic condition. For example, in the risk-seeking ( risk on ) environment, the strategy allocates to risky assets such as equities, commodities, real estates or high yield bonds; in the risk-avoidance ( risk off ) environment, the strategy invests in safe assets such as Treasuries or cash. Instead of forecasting future returns under the traditional active investment framework, the adaptive approach focuses more on identifying the market regimes and conditions and adjusting the investment strategies accordingly.

In the end, I show that this approach can help enhance returns and diversify risks in the context of asset allocation.},

Based on the analytical result, the authors develop an indicator to describe when risk-parity strategies are likely to be more or less optimal. They also explain how negative-Sharpe-ratio assets can still be an important part of a portfolio-whether it is a risk-parity portfolio or not.

The author constructs an objective measure, which is termed a "secular market indicator (SMI)," using a modified Shiller Cyclically-Adjusted Price Earnings (CAPE) ratio with gold as a reference point. This SMI has slightly greater predictive power than Shiller's CAPE Ratio in that it provides a consistent threshold signal for secular macroeconomic reversals. Finally, the author uses the SMI to create a simple decision rule to shift asset allocation between equity and gold depending on the secular market cycle. The resulting portfolio outperforms an all-equity portfolio and an all-gold portfolio over holding periods of 10+ years about 70\% of the time and produces superior risk-adjusted performance about 80\% of the time.},

We can characterize these regimes by futures market returns, finding patterns between risk-on and risk-off assets. One of those regimes is especially "risk-off". We can also characterize these regimes by CS hedge fund index returns. In the "risk-off" regime, they also underperform. The Eurekahedge EHF funds show a similar performance behaviour according to strategies across regimes as the CS hedge fund indices. The dispersion across the Eurekahedge EHF funds for each month is largest in the "risk-off" regime.},

Although the regimes captured by regime-switching models are identified by an econometric procedure, they often correspond to different periods in regulation, policy, and other secular changes. In empirical estimates, the means, volatilities, autocorrelations, and cross-covariances of asset returns often differ across regimes in a manner that allows regime-switching models to capture the stylized behavior of many financial series including fat tails, heteroskedasticity, skewness, and time-varying correlations. In equilibrium models, regimes in fundamental processes, such as consumption or dividend growth, strongly affect the dynamic properties of equilibrium asset prices and can induce nonlinear risk-return trade-offs. Regime switches also lead to potentially large consequences for investors' optimal portfolio choice.},

A preliminary study into the existence of regimes for break-even inflation is also conducted and indications of regimes are found. One of these regimes has no equivalence in interest rates; it exhibits negative elasticity slope which may imply a similar regime if rate levels also reach sufficiently negative values. The overall shape of inflation elasticity resembles a strangle payoff, and we hypothesise that this directly reflects markets response to macroeconomic policy of inflation targeting and also indirectly links such policy to the nominal rate regimes. We demonstrate that the incorporation of such regimes in market risk modelling improves its predictive capacity, and for counterparty risk modelling has significant impact on risk and regulatory calculations.},

To build well-diversified portfolios of factors, one needs to account for the fact that different factors may have similar dependencies on macroeconomic conditions. The authors provide a protocol for selecting relevant macroeconomic state variables that reflect changes in expectations about the aggregate economy. They show that returns of standard equity factors depend significantly on such state variables. Factor returns also depend on aggregate macroeconomic regimes reflecting good and bad times. These macroeconomic risks have strong portfolio implications. For example, some equity factors depend on interest rate risk. Investors who already have exposure to this risk through bond investments may increase loss risk when tilting to the wrong equity factors. The authors also show that standard multifactor allocations do not sufficiently address macroeconomic conditionality. Combining factors may not reduce macroeconomic risks even for factors with low correlation. Understanding macroeconomic risks is a prerequisite both for risk transparency and for improving diversification of equity factor investments.},

In such a setting, being unable to assign reliable point estimates to the probabilities (or frequencies) of the states creates the ambiguity. We first describe how this ambiguity can be modeled probabilistically. Then, we show how this added uncertainty can be dealt with in optimal asset allocation problems. In simple-yet-realistic example applications we demonstrate that without sacrificing much of the upside, ambiguity managed portfolios may enhance the uniformity of returns across different states when compared to portfolios constructed by traditional methods. We stress that a key conclusion to be taken from these methods builds the case for insurance-like and potentially negative-yielding investments such as bonds and commodities so as to hedge the unforeseeable macrouncertainties for a smoother portfolio performance. Finally, we offer a variety of problem domains in which ambiguity management can be nested including macroeconomic scenario-based asset allocation, investing with regime-switching models, momentum investing, and risk-based investing.},

However, investors typically overlook the potential for correlation patterns to help predict subsequent return and risk. Kritzman and Li (2010) introduced what is perhaps the first measure to capture the degree of multivariate asset price 'unusualness' through time. Their financial turbulence score spikes when asset prices 'behave in an uncharacteristic fashion, including extreme price moves, decoupling of correlated assets, and convergence of uncorrelated assets.'

We extend Kritzman and Li's study by disentangling the volatility and correlation components of turbulence to derive a measure of correlation surprise. We show how correlation surprise is orthogonal to volatility and present empirical evidence that it contains incremental forward-looking information. On average, after controlling for volatility, we find that periods characterized by correlation surprise lead to higher risk and lower returns to risk premia than periods characterized by typical correlations. This result holds across many markets including US equities, European equities and foreign exchange.

Our results corroborate the predictive capacity of turbulence and suggest that its decomposition may also prove fruitful in forecasting investment performance.},

We contend that the nature of relations between economic variables and returns differs according to the level of inflation, due to different economic risk implications. An increase in low level inflation may signal improving economic conditions and lower expected returns, while the opposite is true with an equal rise in high level inflation. Linear estimation provides contradictory coefficient values, which we argue arises from mixing coefficient values across regimes. We test for and estimate threshold models with inflation and the term structure as the threshold variable. These models reveal a change in either the sign or magnitude of the parameter values across the regimes such that the relation between stock returns and economic variables is not constant. Measures of in-sample fit and a forecast exercise support the threshold models. They produce a higher adjusted R2, lower MAE and RMSE and higher trading related measures. These results help explain the lack of consistent empirical evidence in favour of stock return predictability and should be of interest to those engaged in stock market modelling as well as trading and portfolio management.},

We find that the LPPLS framework is able to successfully capture, ex-ante, some of the prominent bubbles across different time scales, such as the Black Monday, Dot-com, and Subprime Crisis periods. We then show that measures of short selling activity have robust predictive power over negative bubbles across both short and long time horizons, in line with the previous studies suggesting that short sellers have predictive ability over stock price crash risks. Market liquidity, on the other hand, is found to have robust predictive power over both the negative and positive bubbles, while its predictive power is largely limited to short horizons. Short selling and liquidity are thus identified as two important factors contributing to the LPPLS-based bubble indicators. The evidence overall points to the predictability of stock market bubbles using market-based proxies of trading activity and can be used as a guideline to model and monitor the occurrence of bubble conditions in financial markets.},

Existing transition detection methods, however, do not rigorously account for time series uncertainties, often neglecting them altogether or assuming them to be independent and qualitatively similar. Here, we introduce a novel approach suited to handle uncertainties by representing the time series as a time-ordered sequence of probability density functions. We show how to detect abrupt transitions in such a sequence using the community structure of networks representing probabilities of recurrence. Using our approach, we detect transitions in global stock indices related to well-known periods of politico-economic volatility. We further uncover transitions in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation which coincide with periods of phase locking with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Finally, we provide for the first time an 'uncertainty-aware' framework which validates the hypothesis that ice-rafting events in the North Atlantic during the Holocene were synchronous with a weakened Asian summer monsoon.},

Crashes tend to efficiently bring back excess bubble prices close to a "normal" process. Then, the RE condition implies that the excess risk premium of the risky asset exposed to crashes is an increasing function of the amplitude of the expected crash, which itself grows with the bubble mispricing: hence, the larger the bubble price, the larger its subsequent growth rate. This positive feedback of price on return is the archetype of super-exponential price dynamics. We use the RE condition to estimate the real-time crash probability dynamically through an accelerating probability function depending on the increasing expected return. After showing how to estimate the model parameters, we obtain a closed-form approximation for the optimal investment that maximizes the expected log of wealth (Kelly criterion) for the risky bubbly asset and a risk-free asset. We demonstrate, on seven historical crashes, the promising outperformance of the method compared to a 60/40 portfolio, the classic Kelly allocation, and the risky asset, and how it mitigates jumps, both positive and negative.},

Recent CPD methods demonstrated the potential of using deep learning techniques, but often lack the ability to identify more subtle changes in the autocorrelation statistics of the signal and suffer from a high false alarm rate. To address these issues, we employ an autoencoder-based methodology with a novel loss function, through which the used autoencoders learn a partially time-invariant representation that is tailored for CPD. The result is a flexible method that allows the user to indicate whether change points should be sought in the time domain, frequency domain or both. Detectable change points include abrupt changes in the slope, mean, variance, autocorrelation function and frequency spectrum. We demonstrate that our proposed method is consistently highly competitive or superior to baseline methods on diverse simulated and real-life benchmark data sets. Finally, we mitigate the issue of false detection alarms through the use of a postprocessing procedure that combines a matched filter and a newly proposed change point score. We show that this combination drastically improves the performance of our method as well as all baseline methods.},

To detect such changes, several promising correlation change tests exist, but they may suffer from severe loss of power when there is actually more than one change point underlying the data. To deal with this drawback, we propose a permutation based significance test for Kernel Change Point (KCP) detection on the running correlations. Given a requested number of change points K, KCP divides the time series into K+1 phases by minimizing the within-phase variance. The new permutation test looks at how the average within-phase variance decreases when K increases and compares this to the results for permuted data. The results of an extensive simulation study and applications to several real data sets show that, depending on the setting, the new test performs either at par or better than the state-of-the art significance tests for detecting the presence of correlation changes, implying that its use can be generally recommended.},

Under the hypothesis of stationary time series and under the assumption of a change with decreasing change-point height, the asymptotic distributions of corresponding test statistics are derived. For this, a uniform reduction principle for the sequential empirical process in a two-parameter Skorohod space equipped with a weighted supremum norm is proved. Moreover, we compare the efficiency of rank tests resulting from the consideration of different score functions. Under Gaussianity, the asymptotic relative efficiency of rank-based tests with respect to the CuSum test is 1, irrespective of the score function. Regarding the practical implementation of rank-based change-point tests, we suggest to combine self-normalized rank statistics with subsampling. The theoretical results are accompanied by simulation studies that, in particular, allow for a comparison of rank tests resulting from different score functions. With respect to the finite sample performance of rank-based change-point tests, the Van der Waerden rank test proves to be favorable in a broad range of situations. Finally, we analyze data sets from economy, hydrology, and network traffic monitoring in view of structural changes and compare our results to previous analysis of the data.},

The law of one price would dictate that firms of similar financial standing share similar fundamentals. We investigate the variation in market capitalization normalized by fundamentals that is estimated by Lasso regression of a firm  financial standing. The market capitalization distribution has a substantially heavier upper tail during bubble periods, namely, the market capitalization gap opens up in a small subset of firms with similar fundamentals. This phenomenon suggests that speculative funds concentrate in this subset.

To manage short term risk (cyclicality and underperformance), we build a dynamic asset allocation system using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We use a variety of portfolio construction techniques to test our smart beta strategies and the resulting portfolios show an improvement in risk-adjusted returns, especially on more return-oriented portfolios (up to 50\% of return in excess of market adjusted by relative risk annually). In addition, we propose a novel smart beta allocation system based on the Feature Saliency HMM (FSHMM) algorithm that performs feature selection simultaneously with the training of the HMM, to improve regime identification. We evaluate our systematic trading system with real life assets using MSCI indices; further, the results (up to 60\% of return in excess of market adjusted by relative risk annually) show model performance improvement with respect to portfolios built using full feature HMMs.},

Popular tools for modeling financial time series are hidden Markov models, where a latent state process is used to explicitly model switches among different market regimes. In their basic form, however, hidden Markov models are not capable of capturing both short- and long-term trends, which can lead to a misinterpretation of short-term price fluctuations as changes in the long-term trend. In this paper, we demonstrate how hierarchical hidden Markov models can be used to draw a comprehensive picture of financial markets, which can contribute to the development of more sophisticated trading strategies. The feasibility of the suggested approach is illustrated in two real-data applications, where we model data from two major stock indices, the Deutscher Aktienindex and the Standard \& Poor's 500.},

A typical example of such a dataset is financial data where specific events trigger sudden irregular changes in the sequence of the data. Traditional deep-learning methods perform poorly or even fail when trying to analyse these datasets. The results of a systematic literature review reveal the dominance of frameworks based on recurrent neural networks. The performance of deep-learning frameworks was found to be evaluated mainly using mean absolute error and root mean square error accuracy metrics. Underlying challenges that were identified are: lack of performance robustness, non-transparency of the methodology, internal and external architectural design and configuration issues. These challenges provide an opportunity to improve the framework for complex irregular-patterned sequential datasets.},

  abstract     = {Inferring causal relations from observational time series data is a key problem across science and engineering whenever experimental interventions are infeasible or unethical. Increasing data availability over the past decades has spurred the development of a plethora of causal discovery methods, each addressing particular challenges of this difficult task. In this paper we focus on an important challenge that is at the core of time series causal discovery: regime-dependent causal relations. Often dynamical systems feature transitions depending on some, often persistent, unobserved background regime, and different regimes may exhibit different causal relations. Here, we assume a persistent and discrete regime variable leading to a finite number of regimes within which we may assume stationary causal relations. To detect regime-dependent causal relations, we combine the conditional independence-based PCMCI method with a regime learning optimisation approach. PCMCI allows for linear and nonlinear, high-dimensional time series causal discovery. Our method, Regime-PCMCI, is evaluated on a number of numerical experiments demonstrating that it can distinguish regimes with different causal directions, time lags, effects and sign of causal links, as well as changes in the variables' autocorrelation. Further, Regime-PCMCI is employed to observations of El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation and Indian rainfall, demonstrating skill also in real-world datasets.},

The author applies measures to compensate for class imbalance and uses various performance metrics to evaluate and compare models. With these measures in place, ensemble machine learning models predict recessions with high accuracy and great reliability. In particular, a random forest model achieves a near perfect true-positive rate within the historical training sample, generalizes extremely well to a test period containing the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and shows elevated recession probabilities during the last few months of 2019, associated with the tightened macroeconomic environment and worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.},

In turn, these regime-dependent parameters serve as the inputs during mean-variance optimization, thereby constructing portfolios adapted to the current market environment. Through this formulation, the proposed model allows for the construction of large, realistic portfolios at no additional computational cost during optimization. Moreover, the viability of this model can be significantly improved by periodically rebalancing the portfolio, ensuring proper alignment between the estimated parameters and the transient market regimes. An out-of-sample computational experiment over a long investment horizon shows that the proposed regime-dependent portfolios are better aligned with the market environment, yielding a higher ex post rate of return and lower volatility than competing portfolios.},

Investors most commonly access agriculture in public markets through funds that invest in agricultural commodity futures or the common stock of companies that engage in agribusiness. In general, funds that invest in agricultural commodities are either dedicated equity or futures managers. However, there are potentially significant performance benefits to investing in agricultural commodities through a single multi-asset vehicle composed of both agricultural commodity futures and agribusiness stocks. To that end, in this article the author examines the performance of a multi-asset agriculture portfolio in periods of high and low economic growth and compares it with the performance of its individual equity and futures components, as well as the broader stock market and investment-grade bonds. The author finds that in terms of return generation, risk mitigation, and diversification potential relative to core stocks and bonds, the multi-asset agriculture strategy makes a compelling case for inclusion alongside traditional strategies within institutional investors  portfolios.},

When the model is misspecified or misestimated, however, it often leads to unrealistically rapid switching dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel estimation approach based on clustering temporal features while penalizing jumps. We compare the approach to spectral clustering and the standard approach of maximizing the likelihood function in an extensive simulation study and an application to financial data. The advantages of the proposed jump estimator include that it learns the hidden state sequence and model parameters simultaneously and faster while providing control over the transition rate, it is less sensitive to initialization, it performs better when the number of states increases, and it is robust to misspecified conditional distributions. The value of estimating the true persistence of the state process is illustrated through a simple trading strategy where improved estimates result in much lower transaction costs. Robustness is particularly critical when the model is part of a system used in production. Therefore, our proposed estimator significantly improves the potential for using hidden Markov models in practical applications.},

To this end, we seek to incorporate into the macroeconomic framework a dynamic stock market model based on opinion interactions (Gusev et al., 2015 ). We derive this model from microfoundations, provide its empirical verification, demonstrate that it contains the efficient market as a particular regime and establish a link through which macroeconomic models can be attached for the study of real economy and stock market interaction. To examine key effects, we link it with a simple macroeconomic model (Blanchard, 1981 ). The coupled system generates nontrivial endogenous dynamics, which exhibit deterministic and stochastic features, producing quasiperiodic fluctuations (business cycles). We also inspect this system's behavior in the phase space. The real economy and the stock market coevolve dynamically along the path governed by a stochastically-forced dynamical system with two stable equilibria, one where the economy expands and the other where it contracts, resulting in business cycles identified as the coherence resonance phenomenon. Thus, the incorporation of stock market dynamics into the macroeconomic framework, as presented here, allows the derivation of realistic behaviors in a tractable setting.},

We have documented that effectively, there is present a premium for actively manage the strategies, giving evidence against the idea that managers destroy capital. We then propose the volatility spread as the active management factor into the Carhart's model used to evaluate trading strategies with respect to a benchmark portfolio.},

  abstract     = {Change point detection is an important part of time series analysis, as the presence of a change point indicates an abrupt and significant change in the data generating process. While many algorithms for change point detection exist, little attention has been paid to evaluating their performance on real-world time series. Algorithms are typically evaluated on simulated data and a small number of commonly-used series with unreliable ground truth. Clearly this does not provide sufficient insight into the comparative performance of these algorithms. Therefore, instead of developing yet another change point detection method, we consider it vastly more important to properly evaluate existing algorithms on real-world data. To achieve this, we present the first data set specifically designed for the evaluation of change point detection algorithms, consisting of 37 time series from various domains. Each time series was annotated by five expert human annotators to provide ground truth on the presence and location of change points. We analyze the consistency of the human annotators, and describe evaluation metrics that can be used to measure algorithm performance in the presence of multiple ground truth annotations. Subsequently, we present a benchmark study where 14 existing algorithms are evaluated on each of the time series in the data set. This study shows that binary segmentation (Scott and Knott, 1974) and Bayesian online change point detection (Adams and MacKay, 2007) are among the best performing methods. Our aim is that this data set will serve as a proving ground in the development of novel change point detection algorithms.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, the increased accessibility of large computing power, together with the availability of big data and the relevant progress in algorithms, led to an exponential increment of Machine Learning (ML) applications to predictive tasks concerning complex systems. In general, ML automatically builds a model of the system under study by exploiting an available large dataset of input features coupled to the corresponding expected outputs. While automatically learning models from data is an extremely powerful approach, in the case of complex systems' dynamics the generalization ability of ML models can easily be limited, that is, the predictions can be inaccurate once the model is applied beyond the bounds of previously observed data. On the other hand, a traditional field that deals with predicting the dynamics of complex systems is represented by Modelling and Simulation (M\&S), in which, thanks to the knowledge of sufficient details concerning interactions and processes within the system under study, an abstract representation of it is developed and used for artificially reproducing its behaviour. Compared to ML models, when the M\&S approach can be based on a sound theory about the functioning of the system, it can enable, in the line of principle, a more reliable forecasting of the system's dynamics beyond the bound defined by the observed historical behaviour. In spite of the outlined conceptual distance between the ML and M\&S approaches, a recent and promising research trend encompasses their synergic combination for producing better data-driven simulation models. On the basis of an analysis of the relevant and recent scientific literature, the paper discusses new ideas and directions concerning M\&S approaches based on advanced ML techniques.},

We consider the uncertainty in hidden economic states and define {WSCVaR} as {CVaR} in the worst mixture regime to capture extreme risk in times of crisis. We compare our model with the models without regime switching or robustness in an empirical study of thirteen market indices. The results show that our model can select assets with smaller lower tail dependence and outperforms other models in dynamic investments. In particular during periods of crisis, our model performs most robustly in terms of the highest return and smallest risk. This also shows that regime switching R-Vine copulas can capture extreme tail dependence in times of crisis and {WSCVaR} with respect to regime switchig copulas can assess extreme risk in times of crisis adequately.},

This allows for results from the frequentist and Bayesian literatures to be bridged together. In this estimation framework, one can rely on the consistency of the number and locations of the estimated CPs and the computational efficiency of frequentist methods, and obtain a probability of observing a CP at a given time, compute model posterior probabilities, and select or combine CP methods via Bayesian posteriors. This approach is further extended to other popular information criteria (such as Akaike, Bayes, and Hannan-Quinn's). Moreover, we propose several CP methods that take advantage of the MDL probabilistic representation. Based on simulated and macroeconomic data, the novel methods detect and date structural breaks with the same or improved level of accuracy than state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we highlight the usefulness of combining CP methods for long time series, both in terms of improved detection accuracy and reduced computational cost.},

Change-point testing and estimation are based on maximally selected weighted cumulated sum (CUSUM) statistics. Large sample approximations under a change-point regime are provided including a multivariate CUSUM transform of increasing dimension. For the unknown asymptotic variance and covariance parameters associated to (pairs of) CUSUM statistics we propose consistent estimators. Based on weak laws of large numbers for their sequential versions, we also consider stopped sample estimation where observations until the estimated change-point are used. Finite sample properties of the procedures are investigated by simulations and their application is illustrated by analyzing a real data set from environmetrics.},

The framework is illustrated with a multi-asset allocation exercise over the period 1974-2016.

Our approach is computationally efficient as it involves analysing each time-series independently to obtain a profile-likelihood like quantity that summarizes the evidence for the series having either no change or a specific value for its most recent changepoint. We then post-process this output from each time-series to obtain a potentially small set of times for the most recent changepoints, and, for each time, the set of series that has their most recent changepoint at that time.

We propose an indirect quantitative test of this hypothesis and confront it with the alternative according to which bubbles persist due to the difficulty of agreeing on the end of bubbles. We present systematic tests of the precision and reliability with which the beginning t1 and end tc of a bubble can be determined.For this, we use a specific bubble model, the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) model, which represents a bubble as a transient noisy super-exponential price trajectory decorated by accelerated volatility oscillations. Generalising the estimation procedure to endogenise the beginning of the fitting time interval, we quantify the uncertainty on the calibrated t1 and tc (as well as the other model parameters) via the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, which characterise the shape of the calibration cost function in the different directions in parameter space, on many synthetic data and four historical bubble cases. We find overwhelming evidence that the beginning of bubbles is much better constrained that their end. Our results are robust over all four empirical bubbles and many synthetic tests, as well as when changing the time of analysis (the present ) during the development of the bubbles. As a bonus, we find that the two structural parameters of the LPPLS model, the exponent m controlling the super-exponential growth of price and the angular log-periodic frequency omega describing the log-periodic acceleration of volatility, are very rigid according the Hessian matrix analysis, which supports the LPPLS model as a reasonable candidate for describing the generating process of prices during bubbles.},

Minimising this cost function is possible using dynamic programming, but their algorithm had a computational cost that is cubic in the length of the data set. To speed up computation, Zou et al. (2014) resorted to a screening procedure which means that the estimated segmentation is no longer guaranteed to be the global minimum of the cost function. We show that the screening procedure adversely affects the accuracy of the changepoint detection method, and show how a faster dynamic programming algorithm, pruned exact linear time (PELT) (Killick et al. 2012), can be used to find the optimal segmentation with a computational cost that can be close to linear in the amount of data. PELT requires a penalty to avoid under/over-fitting the model which can have a detrimental effect on the quality of the detected changepoints. To overcome this issue we use a relatively new method, changepoints over a range of penalties (Haynes et al. 2016), which finds all of the optimal segmentations for multiple penalty values over a continuous range. We apply our method to detect changes in heart-rate during physical activity.},

Both universes have been shown to have superior performance in strategy using HMM in common. By examining the change in the weight of the portfolio, the weight change between the asset classes occurs dynamically. This shows that HMM increases the weight of stocks when stock price rises and increases the weight of bonds when stock price falls. As a result of analyzing the performance, it was shown that the HMM effectively reflects the asset selection effect in Jensen's alpha, Fama's Net Selectivity and Treynor-Mazuy model. In addition, the strategy of the HMM has positive gamma value even in the Treynor-Mazuy model. Ultimately, HMM is expected to enable stable management compared to existing momentum strategies by having asset selection effect and market forecasting ability.},

One idea that can be used to understand such markets and has been gaining popularity recently is that of regimes and regime-switching models. In this research, we consider whether regimes can add value to the asset allocation process. Four methods for regime identification -- economic cycle variables, fundamental valuation metrics, technical market indicators and statistical regime-switching models -- are discussed and tested on two asset universes -- longonly South African equity factor returns and representative balanced portfolio asset class returns. We find several promising regime indicators and use these to create two regime-based tactical allocation frameworks. Out-of-sample testing on both the equity factor and balanced asset class data shows very promising results, with both regime-based tactical strategies outperforming their respective static benchmarks on an absolute return and risk-adjusted return basis. We also turn our attention to a potentially major recent development in the local fund management space; namely, the introduction of Capped Shareholder-Weighted indices as new benchmarks. We provide comparative analysis between the capped and uncapped Shareholder-Weighted indices in terms of sector weights, stock concentration, currency exposure and factor risk contributions.},

  abstract         = {In this article, we show how to take into account skewness risk in portfolio allocation. Until recently, this issue has been seen as a purely statistical problem, since skewness corresponds to the third statistical moment of a probability distribution. However, in finance, the concept of skewness is more related to extreme events that produce portfolio losses. More precisely, the skewness measures the outcome resulting from bad times and adverse scenarios in financial markets. Based on this interpretation of the skewness risk, we focus on two approaches that are closely connected. The first one is based on the Gaussian mixture model with two regimes: a normal regime and a turbulent regime. The second approach directly incorporates a stress scenario using jump-diffusion modeling. This second approach can be seen as a special case of the first approach. However, it has the advantage of being clearer and more in line with the experience of professionals in financial markets: skewness is due to negative jumps in asset prices. After presenting the mathematical framework, we analyze an investment portfolio that mixes risk premia, more specifically risk parity, momentum and carry strategies. We show that traditional portfolio management based on the volatility risk measure is biased and corresponds to a short-sighted approach to bad times. We then propose to replace the volatility risk measure by a skewness risk measure, which is calculated as an expected shortfall that incorporates a stress scenario. We conclude that constant-mix portfolios may be better adapted than actively managed portfolios, when the investment universe is composed of negatively skewed financial assets.},

We identify four phases in the business cycle and find that these capture pronounced time variation in the risk and return properties of asset classes. Time variation is also observed in the risk of a traditional, static strategic asset mix.

In order to stabilize risk across the business cycle, we propose a dynamic strategic asset allocation approach, which has the potential to enhance expected return as well. The proposed investment framework is found to be robust to variations in the variable composition of the business cycle indicator and can easily be extended with different economic variables and/or additional assets.},

Most extant methods are constructed for a fixed sample of data and, as such, are appropriate only when applied as one-shot tests. Sequential application of these tests, declaring the presence of a bubble as soon as one of these statistics exceeds the one-shot critical value, would yield a detection procedure with an unknown false-positive rate likely to be far in excess of the nominal level. Our approach sequentially applies the one-shot tests of Astill et al. (2017), comparing sub-sample statistics calculated in real time during the monitoring period with the corresponding sub-sample statistics obtained from a prior training period. We propose two procedures: one based on comparing the real-time monitoring period statistics with the maximum statistic over the training period, and another that compares the number of consecutive exceedances of a threshold value in the monitoring and training periods, the threshold value obtained from the training period. Both allow the practitioner to determine the false-positive rate for any given monitoring horizon, or to ensure that this rate does not exceed a specified level by setting a maximum monitoring horizon. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the finite-sample false-positive rates lie close to their theoretical counterparts, even in the presence of time-varying volatility and serial correlation in the shocks. The procedures are shown to perform well in the presence of a bubble in the monitoring period, offering the possibility of rapid detection of an emerging bubble in a real-time setting. An empirical application to monthly stock market index data is considered.},

  abstract         = {We simulate a simplified version of the price process including bubbles and crashes proposed in Kreuser and Sornette (2018). The price process is defined as a geometric random walk combined with jumps modelled by separate, discrete distributions associated with positive (and negative) bubbles. The key ingredient of the model is to assume that the sizes of the jumps are proportional to the bubble size. Thus, the jumps tend to efficiently bring back excess bubble prices close to a normal or fundamental value (efficient crashes). This is different from existing processes studied that assume jumps that are independent of the mispricing. The present model is simplified compared to Kreuser and Sornette (2018) in that we ignore the possibility of a change of the probability of a crash as the price accelerates above the normal price. We study the behaviour of investment strategies that maximize the expected log of wealth (Kelly criterion) for the risky asset and a risk-free asset. We show that the method behaves similarly to Kelly on Geometric Brownian Motion in that it outperforms other methods in the long-term and it beats classical Kelly. As a primary source of outperformance, we determine knowledge about the presence of crashes, but interestingly find that knowledge of only the size, and not the time of occurrence, already provides a significant and robust edge. We then perform an error analysis to show that the method is robust with respect to variations in the parameters. The method is most sensitive to errors in the expected return.},

Because Markov switching models use both the mean and the variance to infer the state, they produce superior forecasts and lead to significantly better out-of-sample performance than rule-based methods. We conclude that the variance is a crucial ingredient for forecasting the market state.},

First, we identify the period during which two important Bitcoin bubbles occurred based on the generalized supremum augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) method. There are two   significant bubble cycles. The first bubble lasted approximately 26 days from November 25, 2017, to December 21, 2017, while the second bubble lasted approximately one week from June 22 to June 29, 2019. The occurrence of the first bubble was related to the considerable expansion of initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2017, while the formation of the second bubble was affected by the release of Libra. Second, as the GSADF method cannot be used to accurately infer the time at which a bubble bursts, we employ the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) model for this purpose. We verify that the LPPLS method can not only infer the timing of a bubble burst but also shows stable results. Finally, we demonstrate the implications of the 2019 bubble. During the 2019 bubble, due to the increased supervision of European and American governments and the impact of hedging assets, the bubble's duration was shorter, and the positive feedback mechanism was not as strong as that of the 2017 bubble. In addition, the oscillating frequency of the bubble in 2019 was low and unstable, which means that it would be more beneficial for investors to hold the currency for a long time.},

We derive a Kelly trading strategy for the new model. We combine the strategy with a simplified estimation procedure for the model parameters from price time series. We optimize the control parameters of the trading strategy by maximizing the return-weighted accuracy of trades. This enables us to predict the out-of-sample optimal investment, purely based on in-sample calibration of the model on historical data. Our approach solves the difficult problem of selecting the portfolio rebalancing time, as we endogenize it as an optimization parameter. We develop an ex-ante backtest that allows us to test our strategy on twenty equity asset indices. We find that our trading strategy achieves positive trading performance for 95\% of tested assets and outperforms the Buy-and-Hold-Strategy in terms of CAGR and Sharpe Ratio in 60\% of cases. In our simulations, we do not allow for any short trading or leverage. Thus, we simply simulate allocation of 0-100\% of one's capital between a risk-free and the risky asset over time. The optimal rebalancing periods are mostly of duration around a month; thus, the model does not overtrade, ensuring reasonable trading costs. Furthermore, during crashes, the model reduces the invested amount of capital sufficiently soon to reduce impact of price drawdowns. In addition to the Dotcom bubble, the great financial crisis of 2008 and other historical crashes, our study also covers the most recent crash in March 2020 that happened globally as a consequence of the economic shutdowns that were imposed as a reaction to the spread of the Coronavirus across the world.},

The price process is defined as a geometric random walk combined with jumps modelled by separate, discrete distributions associated with positive (and negative) bubbles. The key ingredient of the model is to assume that the sizes of the jumps are proportional to the bubble size. Thus, the jumps tend to efficiently bring back excess bubble prices close to a "normal" or fundamental value ("efficient crashes"). This is different from existing processes studied that assume jumps that are independent of the mispricing. The present model is simplified compared to Kreuser and Sornette (2018) in that we ignore the possibility of a change of the probability of a crash as the price accelerates above the normal price. We study the behaviour of investment strategies that maximize the expected log of wealth (Kelly criterion) for the risky asset and a risk-free asset. We show that the method behaves similarly to Kelly on Geometric Brownian Motion in that it outperforms other methods in the long-term and it beats classical Kelly. As a primary source of outperformance, we determine knowledge about the presence of crashes, but interestingly find that knowledge of only the size, and not the time of occurrence, already provides a significant and robust edge. We then perform an error analysis to show that the method is robust with respect to variations in the parameters. The method is most sensitive to errors in the expected return.},

In this paper we present a novel framework for the detection of regime switches within the US financial markets. Principal component analysis is applied for dimensionality reduction and the k-means algorithm is used as a clustering technique. Using a combination of cluster analysis and classification, we identify regimes in financial markets based on publicly available economic data. We display the efficacy of the framework by constructing and assessing the performance of two trading strategies based on detected regimes.},

Our contributions are threefold: (i) the use of contextual information also referred to as augmented state in DRL, (ii) the impact of a one period lag between observations and actions that is more realistic for an asset management environment, (iii) the implementation of a new repetitive train test method called walk forward analysis, similar in spirit to cross validation for time series. Although our experiment is on trading bots, it can easily be translated to other bot environments that operate in sequential environment with regime changes and noisy data. Our experiment for an augmented asset manager interested in finding the best portfolio for hedging strategies achieves superior returns and lower risk.

The second sub network plays an important role as it captures dependencies with common financial indicators features like risk aversion, economic surprise index and correlations between assets that allows taking into account context based information. We compare different network architectures either using layers of convolutions to reduce network's complexity or LSTM block to capture time dependency and whether previous allocations is important in the modeling.

  abstract         = {Graphical models and in particular Hidden Markov Models or their continuous space equivalent, the so called Kalman filter model, are a powerful tool to make some inference that can be used in decision making contexts. The estimation of their parameters is usually based on the Expectation Maximization approach as this is a natural statistical way to train them. When used for decision making, it may be more relevant to find parameters that are relevant to our decisions rather than just try to fit the model from a statistical point of view. Hence, we can reformulate the determination of graphical model as an inference problem where the true concern is the quality of the decisions from the forecast given by the model. We show that the resulting optimization problem can be reformulated as an information geometric optimization problem and introduce a natural gradient descent strategy that incorporates additional meta parameters. We show that our approach is a strong alternative to the celebrated EM approach for learning in graphical models. Actually, our natural gradient based strategy leads to learning optimal parameters for the final objective function (which is our decision) without artificially trying to fit a distribution that may not correspond to the real one. We support our theoretical findings with the question of decision in financial markets and show that the learned model performs better than traditional practitioner methods and is less prone to overfitting.},

The standard approach based on Markowitz or other more or less sophisticated financial rules aims to find the best portfolio allocation thanks to forecasted expected returns and risk but fails to fully relate market conditions to hedging strategies decision. In contrast, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can tackle this challenge by creating a dynamic dependency between market information and hedging strategies allocation decisions. In this paper, we present a realistic and augmented DRL framework that: (i) uses additional contextual information to decide an action, (ii) has a one period lag between observations and actions to account for one day lag turnover of common asset managers to rebalance their hedge, (iii) is fully tested in terms of stability and robustness thanks to a repetitive train test method called anchored walk forward training, similar in spirit to k fold cross validation for time series and (iv) allows managing leverage of our hedging strategy. Our experiment for an augmented asset manager interested in sizing and timing his hedges shows that our approach achieves superior returns and lower risk.},

In RL, given the current state, the agent makes a decision that may influence the next state as opposed to SL (and USL) where, the next state remains the same, regardless of the decisions taken, either in batch or online learning. Although this difference is fundamental between SL and RL, there are connections that have been overlooked. In particular, we prove in this paper that gradient policy method can be cast as a supervised learning problem where true label are replaced with discounted rewards. We provide a new proof of policy gradient methods (PGM) that emphasizes the tight link with the cross entropy and supervised learning.

We provide a simple experiment where we interchange label and pseudo rewards. We conclude that other relationships with SL could be made if we modify the reward functions wisely.},

However, it remains an open question whether DRL can reach human level in applications to financial problems and in particular in detecting pattern crisis and consequently dis-investing. In this paper, we present an innovative DRL framework consisting in two subnetworks fed respectively with portfolio strategies past performances and standard deviations as well as additional contextual features. The second sub network plays an important role as it captures dependencies with common financial indicators features like risk aversion, economic surprise index and correlations between assets that allows taking into account context based information. We compare different network architectures either using layers of convolutions to reduce network's complexity or LSTM block to capture time dependency and whether previous allocations is important in the modeling. We also use adversarial training to make the final model more robust. Results on test set show this approach substantially over-performs traditional portfolio optimization methods like Markovitz and is able to detect and anticipate crisis like the current COVID one.},

The second sub network plays an important role as it captures dependencies with common financial indicators features like risk aversion, economic surprise index and correlations between assets that allows taking into account context based information. We compare different network architectures either using layers of convolutions to reduce network's complexity or LSTM block to capture time dependency and whether previous allocations is important in the modeling.

This paper aims to bridge the gap between these two approaches by showing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques can shed new lights on portfolio allocation thanks to a more general optimization setting that casts portfolio allocation as an optimal control problem that is not just a one-step optimization, but rather a continuous control optimization with a delayed reward. The advantages are numerous: (i) DRL maps directly market conditions to actions by design and hence should adapt to changing environment, (ii) DRL does not rely on any traditional financial risk assumptions like that risk is represented by variance, (iii) DRL can incorporate additional data and be a multi inputs method as opposed to more traditional optimization methods. We present on an experiment some encouraging results using convolution networks.},

DBNs are directed graphical models of stochastic processes that encompasses and generalize Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Linear Dynamical Systems (LDSs). Whenever we apply these models to economics and finance, we are forced to make some modeling assumptions about the state dynamics and the graph topology (the DBN structure). These assumptions may be incorrectly specified and contain some additional noise compared to reality. Trying to use a best fit approach through maximum likelihood estimation may miss this point and try to fit at any price these models on data. We present here a new methodology that takes a radical point of view and instead focus on the final efficiency of our model. Parameters are hence estimated in terms of their efficiency rather than their distributional fit to the data. The resulting optimization problem that consists in finding the optimal parameters is a hard problem. We rely on Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) method to tackle this issue. We apply this method to the seminal problem of trend detection in financial markets. We see on numerical results that the resulting parameters seem less error prone to over fitting than traditional moving average cross over trend detection and perform better. The method developed here for algorithmic trading is general. It can be applied to other real case applications whenever there is no physical law underlying our DBNs.},

  abstract         = {In this paper, we revisit the Kalman filter theory. After giving the intuition on a simplified financial markets example, we revisit the maths underlying it. We then show that Kalman filter can be presented in a very different fashion using graphical models. This enables us to establish the connection between Kalman filter and Hidden Markov Models. We then look at their application in financial markets and provide various intuitions in terms of their applicability for complex systems such as financial markets. Although this paper has been written more like a self contained work connecting Kalman filter to Hidden Markov Models and hence revisiting well known and establish results, it contains new results and brings additional contributions to the field. First, leveraging on the link between Kalman filter and HMM, it gives new algorithms for inference for extended Kalman filters. Second, it presents an alternative to the traditional estimation of parameters using EM algorithm thanks to the usage of CMA-ES optimization. Third, it examines the application of Kalman filter and its Hidden Markov models version to financial markets, providing various dynamics assumptions and tests. We conclude by connecting Kalman filter approach to trend following technical analysis system and showing their superior performances for trend following detection.},

  abstract         = {Sharpe ratio (sometimes also referred to as information ratio) is widely used in asset management to compare and benchmark funds and asset managers. It computes the ratio of the (excess) net return over the strategy standard deviation. However, the elements to compute the Sharpe ratio, namely, the expected returns and the volatilities are unknown numbers and need to be estimated statistically. This means that the Sharpe ratio used by funds is likely to be error prone because of statistical estimation errors. In this paper, we provide various tests to measure the quality of the Sharpe ratios. By quality, we are aiming at measuring whether a manager was indeed lucky of skillful. The test assesses this through the statistical significance of the Sharpe ratio. We not only look at the traditional Sharpe ratio but also compute a modified Sharpe insensitive to used Capital. We provide various statistical tests that can be used to precisely quantify the fact that the Sharpe is statistically significant. We illustrate in particular the number of trades for a given Sharpe level that provides statistical significance as well as the impact of auto-correlation by providing reference tables that provides the minimum required Sharpe ratio for a given time period and correlation. We also provide for a Sharpe ratio of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 the skill percentage given the auto-correlation level.},

The standard approach based on Markowitz or other more or less sophisticated financial rules aims to find the best portfolio allocation thanks to forecasted expected returns and risk but fails to fully relate market conditions to hedging strategies decision. In contrast, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can tackle this challenge by creating a dynamic dependency between market information and hedging strategies allocation decisions. In this paper, we present a realistic and augmented DRL framework that: (i) uses additional contextual information to decide an action, (ii) has a one period lag between observations and actions to account for one day lag turnover of common asset managers to rebalance their hedge, (iii) is fully tested in terms of stability and robustness thanks to a repetitive train test method called anchored walk forward training, similar in spirit to k fold cross validation for time series and (iv) allows managing leverage of our hedging strategy. Our experiment for an augmented asset manager interested in sizing and timing his hedges shows that our approach achieves superior returns and lower risk.},

The transition between different market regimes is mirrored in correlation matrices, whose time-varying coefficients usually jump higher in highly volatile regimes, leading to the failure of common diversification methods. In this article, we aim to identify market regimes from covariance matrices and detect transitions towards highly volatile regimes, hence improving tail-risk hedging. Starting from the time series of fractionally differentiated sentiment-like future values, two models are applied on monthly realized covariance matrices to detect market regimes. Specifically, the regime detection is implemented via vector logistic smooth transition autoregressive model (VLSTAR) and through an unsupervised learning methodology, the agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Since market regime switches are unobservable processes that describe the latent change of market behaviour, the ability of correctly detecting market regimes is validated in two ways: firstly, randomly generated data are used to assess a correct classification when regimes are known; secondly, a na\"{i}ve trading strategy filtered with the detected regime switches is used to understand whether an improvement is showed when accounting for regime switches. The results point to the VLSTAR as the best performing model for labelling market regimes.},

The computation time of the approximate solution is shown to be practically independent of the number of assets when no predictors are present and only marginally affected by the number of predictors. While the portfolio policy strongly depends on the current state of the economy, the consumption-to-wealth ratio is roughly state-independent. Predictability considerably changes the optimal portfolios. Hedging demands are negligible with regimes and no predictability, but are important with predictability. On the other hand, the consumption-to-wealth ratio is not very impacted by the predictor. We provide an out-of-sample statistical assessment of the returns provided by a multi-regime strategy with respect to a single-regime and to a strategy.},

Based on this viewpoint, we survey certain state-of-the-art tools from geometric and statistical computing in order to handle important and difficult problems in digital finance. Although our tools are quite general, in this paper we focus on two specific questions. The first concerns crisis detection, which is of prime interest for the public in general and for policy makers in particular because of the significant impact that crises have on the economy. Certain features in stock markets lead to this type of anomaly detection: Given the assets' returns, we describe the relationship between portfolios' return and volatility by means of a copula, without making any assumption on investor strategies. We examine a recent method relying on copulae to construct an appropriate indicator that allows us to automate crisis detection. On real data, the indicator detects all past crashes in the cryptocurrency market, whereas from the DJ600-Europe index, from 1990 to 2008, the indicator identifies correctly 4 crises and issues one false positive for which we offer an explanation. Our second contribution is to introduce an original computational framework to model asset allocation strategies, which is of independent interest for digital finance and its applications. Our approach addresses the crucial question of evaluating portfolio management, and is relevant to individual managers as well as financial institutions. To evaluate portfolio performance, we provide a new portfolio score, based on the aforementioned framework and concepts. In particular, our score relies on the statistical properties of portfolios, and we show how they can be computed efficiently.},

This model incorporates market dynamics in an effort to improve parameter estimation. We proceed to use this model for risk parity optimization and also consider the construction of a robust version of the risk parity optimization by introducing uncertainty structures to the estimated market parameters. We test our model by constructing a regime-switching risk parity portfolio based on the Fama-French three-factor model. The out-of-sample computational results show that a regime-switching risk parity portfolio can consistently outperform its nominal counterpart, maintaining a similar ex post level of risk while delivering higher-than-nominal returns over a long-term investment horizon.

We solve this multiple objective problem for a wide range of consumption and annuitization scenarios. For each scenario, we apply dynamic programming to optimally evolve the investments in the non-annuitized portion of the portfolio so as to minimize longevity risk. Our dynamic programming approach has the advantages of (1) generating results that are far superior to what standard Monte Carlo methods, static portfolios, and target date fund glide paths can provide and (2) not requiring utility functions, which are hard to specify for individuals. We show that investors who want to minimize their longevity and legacy risk and who are unable to annuitize their full consumption stream are best off avoiding even partial annuitization of their portfolio. For investors who are able to annuitize their full consumption stream, we quantify their longevity versus legacy risk trade-offs, enabling them to select the best annuity for their needs.},

We apply EXPRES for image classification, few shot learning, and semantic segmentation, and show our method is capable of achieving state of the art prompt tuning on 3/3 categories of the VTAB benchmark. In addition to strong performance, we observe that our approach is an order of magnitude more prompt efficient than existing visual prompting baselines. We analytically show the computational benefits of our approach over weight space adaptation techniques like finetuning. Lastly we systematically corroborate the architectural design of our method via a series of ablation experiments.},

  abstract         = {In predictive modeling for high-stake decision-making, predictors must be not only accurate but also reliable. Conformal prediction (CP) is a promising approach for obtaining the confidence of prediction results with fewer theoretical assumptions. To obtain the confidence set by so-called full-CP, we need to refit the predictor for all possible values of prediction results, which is only possible for simple predictors. For complex predictors such as random forests (RFs) or neural networks (NNs), split-CP is often employed where the data is split into two parts: one part for fitting and another to compute the confidence set. Unfortunately, because of the reduced sample size, split-CP is inferior to full-CP both in fitting as well as confidence set computation. In this paper, we develop a full-CP of sparse high-order interaction model (SHIM), which is sufficiently flexible as it can take into account high-order interactions among variables. We resolve the computational challenge for full-CP of SHIM by introducing a novel approach called homotopy mining. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that SHIM is as accurate as complex predictors such as RF and NN and enjoys the superior statistical power of full-CP.},

Because the goals are in competition for potentially limited financial resources, their relative importance must be specified, which we do by assigning utility weights to each goal. Given these weights, dynamic programming can determine both the optimal investment strategy and the optimal strategy for when to fulfill versus forgo each goal. This yields the optimal goal probabilities for fulfilling each goal. By altering the utility weights, we show how to generate the efficient goal probability frontier (EGPF), an (n - 1)-dimensional hypersurface of the optimized goal probability combinations. Just as the classic efficient frontier in mean-variance portfolio optimization allows investors to understand the trade-offs under the best circumstances between their portfolio's mean and variance, the EGPF allows the investor to under- stand the trade-offs under the best circumstances between the probabilities of attaining each of their goals - without needing to see or understand the goals' underlying utility weights. We extend our EGPF framework to determine the minimal initial wealth needed to attain specified probabilities for each completely or partially fulfilled goal.},

This can be computed quickly, even for numerous investor goals spread over different or concurrent time periods, where each goal may be all-or-nothing or may allow for partial fulfillment. The probabilities of attaining each (full or partial) goal under the optimal scenario are also computed, so the investor can ensure the algorithm accurately reflects their preference for the relative importance of each of their goals.

  abstract         = {Adversarial archetypes exploit the workings of any system to disrupt the robustness and the decision-making of the underlying machine learning algorithms. This is an important area of concern in the banking industry where the global approbation of real-time \& friction less payment systems has prompted the financial institutions to invest in superior authentication solutions. Identifying fraudulent actors poses an inherent challenge for varied reasons - thorough fraud detection can have an impact on customer satisfaction. While fraud detection slows down the authentication process, the customers' demands faster response. Present systems tend to produce numerous false positives, along with being vulnerable to ingenious fraudsters, which in conjunction with dollar loss, also leads to reputation loss for the issuers. In this paper, we present AuthSHAP, a first of its kind, model agnostic and robust implementation of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to uncover the extent to which key features are not appropriated by any model in the decision making. This 'knowledge' is significant information to a fraudsters to design intelligent or adversarial attacks. We show that even in black-box settings, where the attacker only needs to have a fair process or business understanding about the type of information or raw features that are passed through the system and the responses it is possible to understand the vulnerability. Thus, this can be used by any financial institution as an active preventive measure (a) to shield their authentication system from adversarial attacks and, also (b) to reduce false declines to prevent a sub-optimal customer experience amounting to both revenue and reputation loss for entities across the payment value chain. We propose an evaluation method using a simulation where we create a decision system or Model with desired vulnerability and identify the same via our proposed methodology in a black-box setting. We extend this by performing several experiments on aggregated and anonymized real-world financial transaction data and validate our findings with internal subject matter experts.},

Our proposed measure is inspired by MPdist which has been previously proposed for such datasets and is constructed using Euclidean metrics, whereas kdiff is constructed using non-linear kernel distances. Also, kdiff accounts for both self and cross similarities across the instances and is defined using a lower quantile of the distance distribution. Comparing the cross similarity to self similarity allows for measures of similarity that are more robust to noise and partial occlusions of the relevant signals. Our proposed measure kdiff is a more general form of the well known kernel-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distance estimated over the embeddings. Some theoretical results are provided for separability conditions using kdiff as a distance measure for clustering and classification problems where the embedding distributions can be modeled as two component mixtures. Applications are demonstrated for clustering of synthetic and real-life time series and image data, and the performance of kdiff is compared to competing distance measures for clustering.},

The diversity allows users to balance between different needs such as model accuracy vs. latency. By exposing not only the final models but the way they are trained, meaning the pipelines, we allow to customize the generated training pipeline, thus catering the need of users with different levels of expertise. This trait is crucial for users and is the main novelty of Autopilot; it provides a solution that on one hand is not fully black-box and can be further worked on, while on the other hand is not a do it yourself solution, requiring expertise in all aspects of machine learning.

  abstract         = {There is nothing like a market crash to focus the mind on the importance of risk management and, more specifically, tail risk management. Because tail events are generally systemic in nature and are characterised by elevated correlations and liquidity squeezes, effective tail risk management is not just a diversification exercise but rather requires explicit and specialised strategies. The natural question that arises then is how do you create an optimal tail risk management strategy? Most studies identify four categories of tail risk management strategy: option-based hedging, asset allocation, dynamic trading and defensive equity. Within each category, we then find a number of strategies available to investors for managing tail risk. Unfortunately, it remains an open question as to which strategy works best for a given investment scenario, or if there even exists a universally optimal strategy to begin with. We attempt to answer this question by analysing a range of commonly used tail risk management strategies in a South African market setting. However, given the breadth of the four available strategy categories, we split our research on this topic into two parts. In this Part I, we firstly examine and quantify the tail risk inherent in South African markets. This is done through a review the long-term history of equity and bond market drawdowns. Thereafter, we discuss nine core principles that are applicable to all candidate strategies and that define good tail risk management. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of option-based tail hedging strategies. The concepts of defensive, offensive, active and indirect tail hedging are discussed at length and examples of each are implemented on historical market data.},

However, achieving true diversification is easier said than done, especially when we do not fully know what we mean when we are talking about diversification. While the qualitative purpose of diversification is well known, a satisfactory quantitative definition of portfolio diversification remains elusive. In this research, we summarise a wide range of diversification measures, focusing our efforts on those most commonly used in practice. We categorise each measure based on which portfolio aspect it focuses on: cardinality, weights, returns, risk or higher moments. We then apply these measures to a range of South African equity indices, thus giving a diagnostic review of historical local equity diversification and, perhaps more importantly, providing a description of the investable opportunity set available tofund managers in this space. Finally, we introduce the idea of diversification profiles. These regime dependent profiles give a much richer description of portfolio diversification than their single-value counterparts and also allow one to manage diversification proactively based on one's view of future market conditions.},

We show that the existing framework can be readily extended to include a factor-dependent return process using standard models available in the literature. Structural changes in the market conditions are then incorporated into the framework via the use of a regime-switching turbulence index, and the nonlinear and asymmetric market dependence structure is accounted for by using quantile factor models. Most importantly, this extended framework is comprised of a series of linear models only and is thus simple to understand and to implement. We consider two applications of the extended framework, namely, scenario analysis and parameter uncertainty analysis, by way of a simple empirical case study. Finally, we introduce the concept of risk maps, which provide managers with a graphical approach for estimating and evaluating risk optimality in a multiobjective, multiscenario setting.},

They then apply a regime-based asset allocation to nominal risk parity strategy. Investors can further improve their investment performance by implementing a dollar-neutral factor momentum strategy as an overlay in conjunction with the core portfolio. The authors demonstrate that the time-series factor momentum strategy generates high risk-adjusted returns and exhibits pronounced defensive characteristics during market crashes. A volatility scaling approach is employed to manage the risk and further magnify the benefits of factor momentum. Empirical results suggest that the approach improves risk-adjusted returns by a substantial amount over the benchmark from both the standalone perspective and the contributory perspective.},

We formulate this as a covariance-regularized maximum likelihood problem, which can be reduced to a combinatorial optimization problem of searching over the possible breakpoints, or segment boundaries. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming, with complexity that grows with the square of the time series length. We propose a heuristic method that approximately solves the problem in linear time with respect to this length, and always yields a locally optimal choice, in the sense that no change of any one breakpoint improves the objective. Our method, which we call greedy Gaussian segmentation (GGS), easily scales to problems with vectors of dimension over 1000 and time series of arbitrary length. We discuss methods that can be used to validate such a model using data, and also to automatically choose appropriate values of the two hyperparameters in the method. Finally, we illustrate our GGS approach on financial time series and Wikipedia text data.},

Our proposed methods are robust to both the degree of persistence and endogeneity of the regressors in the predictive regression and to certain forms of heteroskedasticity in the shocks. We discuss how the monitoring procedures can be designed such that their false positive rate can be set by the practitioner at the start of the monitoring period using detection rules based on information obtained from the data in a training period. We use these new monitoring procedures to investigate the presence of regime changes in the predictability of the US equity premium at the 1-month horizon by traditional macroeconomic and financial variables, and by binary technical analysis indicators. Our results suggest that the 1-month-ahead equity premium has temporarily been predictable, displaying so-called "pockets of predictability," and that these episodes of predictability could have been detected in real time by practitioners using our proposed methodology.},

  abstract         = {The vulnerability of individuals planning for retirement has been growing due to the conversion from defined-benefit plans to defined-contribution plans, the steady increase in life longevity, and the uncertainty of asset returns under an ever-changing global environment. A serious problem is the lack of appropriate planning for retirement. How much should an individual save beyond the Social Security tax in order to maintain a reasonable lifestyle after retirement? This paper designs a framework to facilitate the process of setting realistic goals for financial planning, featuring the concept of agent-based simulations. The framework also provides policy-rule guidelines for the agent to search for an optimal strategy. Additionally, a micro-macro analysis enables us to analyze a cohort of representative agents and aggregate the individual results on the macro-level. The simulation module employs a regime-based Monte Carlo simulation of multiple asset categories, a factor-based diversifying asset allocation approach, and a collection of dynamic policy-rule-based investment strategies. Empirical results, consisting of a downside risk simulation for university endowments, a sustainability assessment for the Social Security fund, and a personal goal-based retirement planning, demonstrate stylized applications of the planning framework.},

The aim of neural networks in this work is an off-line approximation of complex pricing functions, which are difficult to represent or time-consuming to evaluate by other means. We highlight how this perspective opens new horizons for quantitative modelling: The calibration bottleneck posed by a slow pricing of derivative contracts is lifted. This brings several model families (such as rough volatility models) within the scope of applicability in industry practice. As customary for machine learning, the form in which information from available data is extracted and stored is crucial for network performance. With this in mind, we discuss how our approach addresses the usual challenges of machine learning solutions in a financial context (availability of training data, interpretability of results for regulators, control over generalisation errors). We present specific architectures for price approximation and calibration and optimize these with respect to different objectives regarding accuracy, speed and robustness. We also find that including the intermediate step of learning pricing functions of (classical or rough) models before calibration significantly improves network performance compared to direct calibration to data.},

Specifically, we consider the value of an individual spin to represent the proportional holdings in various assets. We use partial moment arguments to identify asymmetric reactions to information and develop an extension of a plunging and dumping model. This unique identification of the spin is a relaxation of the conventional discrete state limitation on an Ising spin to accommodate a new archetype in Ising model-finance applications wherein spin states may take on continuous values, and may evolve in time continuously, or discretely, depending on the values of the partial moments.},

Next, the authors identify five distinct market regimes characterized by unique asset class behaviors. The factor portfolios are then combined such that the risk contributions to the resulting total portfolio are as balanced as possible, regardless of which market regime materializes. By combining regime-aware correlations with dynamic volatility estimates for each factor and applying standard 1.5x to 2x leverage, the authors demonstrate a risk-parity portfolio with 10\% ex ante volatility and attractive absolute and risk-adjusted returns. Compared with a traditional 60/40 portfolio, the proposed risk-parity portfolio displays greater diversification, more consistent factor-risk contributions, and greater resilience to economic shocks.},

  abstract         = {In this article, we show how to take into account skewness risk in portfolio allocation. Until recently, this issue has been seen as a purely statistical problem, since skewness corresponds to the third statistical moment of a probability distribution. However, in finance, the concept of skewness is more related to extreme events that produce portfolio losses. More precisely, the skewness measures the outcome resulting from bad times and adverse scenarios in financial markets. Based on this interpretation of the skewness risk, we focus on two approaches that are closely connected. The first one is based on the Gaussian mixture model with two regimes: a normal regime and a turbulent regime. The second approach directly incorporates a stress scenario using jump-diffusion modeling. This second approach can be seen as a special case of the first approach. However, it has the advantage of being clearer and more in line with the experience of professionals in financial markets: skewness is due to negative jumps in asset prices. After presenting the mathematical framework, we analyze an investment portfolio that mixes risk premia, more specifically risk parity, momentum and carry strategies. We show that traditional portfolio management based on the volatility risk measure is biased and corresponds to a short-sighted approach to bad times. We then propose to replace the volatility risk measure by a skewness risk measure, which is calculated as an expected shortfall that incorporates a stress scenario. We conclude that constant-mix portfolios may be better adapted than actively managed portfolios, when the investment universe is composed of negatively skewed financial assets.},

By contrast, famous professor Zvi Bodie argues that time diversification is a fallacy and, therefore, his advice to fund managers is to buy long-term portfolio insurance. In this paper, we consider the optimal portfolio choice problem for a loss-averse investor. First, we demonstrate that our loss-averse investor subscribes to the principle of time diversification. In particular, our investor allocates more to stocks as the investment horizon lengthens. Second, we allow our investor to trade in stocks and put options. We find that when the investment horizon is short, our investor is better off with portfolio insurance. Conversely, when the investment horizon is long, our investor sells put options.

We find that the volatility forecast horizon is substantially longer when the market is in a bear state than when it is in a bull state. In addition, over all but the shortest horizons, the volatility forecast accuracy is higher when the market is in a bear state. This difference increases as the forecast horizon lengthens.

  abstract         = {Volatility forecasting is crucial for portfolio management, risk management, and pricing of derivative securities. Still, little is known about the accuracy of volatility forecasts and the horizon of volatility predictability. This paper aims to fill these gaps in the literature. We begin this paper by introducing the notions of the spot and forward predicted volatilities and propose to describe the term structure of volatility predictability by the spot and forward forecast accuracy curves. Then we perform a comprehensive study on the term structure of volatility predictability in the stock and foreign exchange markets. Our results quantify the volatility forecast accuracy across horizons in the two major markets and suggest that the horizon of volatility predictability is significantly longer than that reported in the earlier studies. Nevertheless, the horizon of volatility predictability is found to be much shorter than the longest maturity of traded derivative contracts.},

To this end, we construct early warning systems based on the logistic model and seven machine learning methods, and we also use the Shapley value decomposition and Shapley regression to explore the causality of the machine learning methods. By comparing the performance of different early warning models in out-of-sample tests, we find that the machine learning models, especially the random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, and ensemble models, outperform the logistic model in terms of providing early predictions of financial crises. In addition, the Shapley value can be used to find more effective predictive indicators and analyze the causes of risks in different countries to a certain extent, enabling policymakers to supplement the policy toolbox to deal with such crises. Thus, we suggest that machine learning methods should be considered when establishing early warning systems to predict financial crises in the future.},

This model's significant advantage is its intuitive and reactive design that incorporates the latest asset return regimes to quantitatively solve managers' question: how certain should one be that a given investment view is occurring? First, we describe a framework for multi-period portfolio allocation formulated as a convex optimization problem that trades off expected return, risk and transaction costs. Using a framework borrowed from model predictive control introduced by Boyd et al., we employ optimization to plan a sequence of trades using forecasts of future quantities, only the first set being executed. Multi-period trading lends itself to dynamic readjustment of the portfolio when gaining new information. Second, we use the Black-Litterman model to combine investment views specified in a simple linear combination based format with the market portfolio. A data-driven method to adjust the confidence in the manager's views by comparing them to dynamically updated regime-switching forecasts is proposed. Our contribution is to incorporate both multi-period trading and interpretable investment views into one framework and offer a novel method of using regime-switching to determine each view's confidence. This method replaces portfolio managers' need to provide estimated confidence levels for their views, substituting them with a dynamic quantitative approach. The framework is reactive, tractable and tested on 15 years of daily historical data. In a numerical example, this method's benefits are found to deliver higher excess returns for the same degree of risk in both the case when an investment view proves to be correct, but, more notably, also the case when a view proves to be incorrect. To facilitate ease of use and future research, we also developed an open-source software library that replicates our results},

The procedure is made computationally very efficient and can be used with a large   number of assets. We demonstrate that this procedure is successful at clustering different states of the markets in an unsupervised manner. In particular, we describe an experiment with one hundred log-returns and two states in which the methodology automatically associates states prevalently to pre- and post-crisis periods with one state gathering periods with average positive returns and the other state periods with average negative returns, therefore discovering spontaneously the common classification of "bull" and "bear" markets. In another experiment, with again one hundred log-returns and two states, we demonstrate that this procedure can be efficiently used to forecast off-sample future market states with significant prediction accuracy. This methodology opens the way to a range of applications in risk management and trading strategies in the context where the correlation structure plays a central role.},

  abstract         = {The aim of this thesis is to develop and study mathematical models of financial markets experiencing bubbles and crashes. Our study is based on a model structure that combines increasingly positive returns (the build-up of a bubble) with a sudden reversal and an accumulation of large negative returns (the crash). The occurrence of financial crashes, fueled by bubbles, are widely recognized as disruptive events that have significant adverse effects on the performance of mathematical tools in many financial problem settings. However, models that explicitly incorporate the stylized features of bubble-and-crash dynamics are yet to permeate most areas of (mathematical) finance. 

\leavevmode\newline To address this shortcoming, in the first part of the thesis we develop a general stochastic model framework based on the dialectic view that build-up and implosion of financial bubbles are inherently linked. We show that the framework encompasses a wide range of models from the bubble literature in (financial) economics that focus on market failure as a driver of financial distress. As such, it functions both as a tool to compare the various assumptions underlying such models and as a good starting point to robustify financial problem settings that are affected by bubbles and crashes. Based on this general framework, we pick several specific models combining (possibly explosive) diffusions and single jump processes, study their stochastic and statistical properties and show how they can be applied to a common problem in mathematical finance, the pricing and hedging of European options. Where indicated, we apply our methods to financial data sets. 

\leavevmode\newline The second part of the thesis introduces a class of point processes that combines two wellestablished cluster mechanisms, a self-exciting structure commonly referred to as Hawkes process, and a shot-noise structure known as Neyman-Scott process. As such, these processes are useful in modeling the accumulation of points - for example, the clustering of negative returns during financial crashes within the framework mentioned above. However, given that such point processes transcend the mostly diffusive setting of the first part and show a similarity to ARMA time series of counts, which confirms their wide potential applicability beyond finance, this line of work deserves a distinct part in this thesis. In many cases, missing data complicates statistical estimation for this type of process, and explicit mathematical expressions exist only for (Markovian) special cases. To address this, we derive an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that allows us to estimate general inhomogeneous and non-parametric specifications and marks. We test the algorithm in a range of simulation and case studies.},

Due to their importance in inferential matters, changepoint research on correlated data has accelerated recently. Unfortunately, small perturbations in model assumptions can drastically alter changepoint conclusions; for example, heavy positive correlation in a time series can be misattributed to a mean shift should correlation be ignored. This paper considers both single and multiple changepoint techniques. The paper begins by examining cumulative sum (CUSUM) and likelihood ratio tests and their variants for the single changepoint problem; here, various statistics, boundary cropping scenarios, and scaling methods (e.g., scaling to an extreme value or Brownian Bridge limit) are compared. A recently developed test based on summing squared CUSUM statistics over all times is shown to have realistic Type I errors and superior detection power. The paper then turns to the multiple changepoint setting. Here, penalized likelihoods drive the discourse, with AIC, BIC, mBIC, and MDL penalties being considered. Binary and wild binary segmentation techniques are also compared. We introduce a new distance metric specifically designed to compare two multiple changepoint segmentations. Algorithmic and computational concerns are discussed and simulations are provided to support all conclusions. In the end, the multiple changepoint setting admits no clear methodological winner, performance depending on the particular scenario. Nonetheless, some practical guidance will emerge.},

The analysis is conducted for the British pound, Canadian dollar, and Japanese yen exchange rates against the US dollar over the last 30 years with alternative specifications including a simple segmented trends model and Markov switching autoregressive models with monetary fundamentals. A noteworthy finding is that the number of regimes that minimizes mean square forecast errors tends to correspond to the number of regimes selected by Bayesian information criteria (but not Markov-switching-specific information criteria). For the monetary models, the number of regimes that minimizes forecast errors also tends to correspond to the most parsimonious model with well-behaved residuals. Although allowing for more regimes yields forecasting improvement over single- or two-regime models, the Markov switching model is still unable to outperform a random walk. This suggests that exchange rate models need to allow for novel, as opposed to repetitive or predetermined, structural change.},

Regime shifts refer to the changing behaviors exhibited by series at different time intervals. Learning these changing behaviors is a key step toward time series forecasting. While advances have been made, existing methods suffer from one or more of the following shortcomings: (1) failure to take relationships between time series into consideration for discovering regimes in multiple time series; (2) lack of an effective approach that models time-dependent behaviors exhibited by series; (3) difficulties in handling data discontinuities which may be informative. Most of the existing methods are unable to handle all of these three issues in a unified framework. This, therefore, motivates our effort to devise a principled approach for modeling interactions and time-dependency in co-evolving time series. Specifically, we model an ecosystem of multiple time series by summarizing the heavy ensemble of time series into a lighter and more meaningful structure called a \textit{mapping grid}. By using the mapping grid, our model first learns time series behavioral dependencies through a dynamic network representation, then learns the regime transition mechanism via a full time-dependent Cox regression model. The originality of our approach lies in modeling interactions between time series in regime identification and in modeling time-dependent regime transition probabilities, usually assumed to be static in existing work.},

The study's results support the hypothesis, showing evidence of market overreaction during bear markets and strong price increases at the beginning of bull markets.

One of the bear states represents a regular bear market, while the other corresponds to either a stock market crash or a market correction.

  abstract         = {There is a big controversy among both investment professionals and academics regarding how the termination probability of a market state depends on its age. Using more than two centuries of data on the broad US stock market index, we revisit the duration dependence in bull and bear markets. Our results suggest that the duration dependence for both bull and bear markets is a nonlinear function of the state age. It appears that the duration dependence in bear markets is strictly positive. For 93\% of the bull markets, the duration dependence is also positive. Only about 7\% of the bull markets, those with the longest durations, do not exhibit positive duration dependence. We also compare a few selected theoretical distributions on their ability to describe the duration dependence in bull and bear markets. Our results advocate that the gamma distribution most often provides the best fit for both the survivor and hazard functions of bull and bear markets. However, our results reveal that none of the selected distributions accurately describes the right tail of the hazard functions.},

  abstract         = {In this article, we document a new stock market anomaly that seems to have escaped the attention of both investment professionals and academics alike. We find that over more than a century, the monthly market return has been predicted by the monthly market return at lag 5. This predictability is market-wide and is most evident in the returns of portfolios of large and growth stocks. The trading strategy that incorporates this predictability yields superior performance that cannot be attributed to common risk factors. A closer investigation of the new anomaly reveals that not each calendar month possesses predictive ability. Therefore, there is a linkage between the new anomaly and calendar effects in stock returns.},

  abstract         = {Galvanized by the claims of Greenwood et al. in Bubbles for Fama that "a sharp price increase of an industry portfolio does not, on average, predict unusually low returns going forward", and Fama's quote (June, 2016) that "Statistically, people have not come up with ways of identifying bubbles", we present significant evidence to the contrary of both statements. Using a methodology called logperiodic power law singularity (LPPLS), which has been developed by the Sornette group over more than two decades, we show that a LPPLS-based "bubble confidence indicator" allows one to diagnose ex-ante the presence of a bubble. Using superposed epoch analysis, we find an excellent timing performance of price regime shifts, and more so, the larger the bubble confidence indicator. Moreover, we identify two classes of regime shifts following an accelerated price growth qualified by LPPLS: (i) bubbles followed by a large drawdown or crash, and (ii) price catch-up followed by a plateau, associated with the convergence to a stable price level. Indiscriminately mixing these two types of accelerated transient price increases may explain in part previous failures to diagnose bubbles and their aftermath. While the existence of the first class of transient accelerated price increases followed by crashes is a long-standing puzzle, the existence of the second class of transient accelerated price increases followed by a plateau poses a challenge to the efficient market hypothesis, thus constituting a new puzzle: the convergence to a stable price level, while accelerating, is slow, with investors and the market taking weeks to months to digest available information and to progressively converge to the final higher valuation consensus.},

  abstract         = {This paper employs the hidden semi-Markov model and a novel model selection procedure to detect different states in the US stock market. The empirical results suggest that the market is switching between five states that can be classified into three bull states and two bear states. The three bull states are categorized as a low volatility bull market, a high volatility bull market, and a stock market bubble. One of the bear states represents a regular bear market, while the other one corresponds to either a stock market crash or a market correction. The paper demonstrates that the five-state model is consistent with a number of stylized facts and provides many valuable insights into the dynamics of the US stock market. Besides, the five-state model has clear implications for the success of some active strategies that aim to enhance returns and reduce losses.},
